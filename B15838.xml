            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the end of the Chapter before go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may ſee how Chriſt healed a man, blinde in his bodily ſight, namely, Bartimeus, whereby hee ſheweth himſelfe to be the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of the body: Here we ſhall ſee how he cured one blinde in minde, namely, Zaccheus, whereby he ſheweth himſelfe to bee <note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 23.</note> the Phyſitian of the ſoule, and therefore the Sauiour of the whole man.</p>
                  <p>In ſpeaking of Zaccheus and his conuerſion, we will obſerue foure circumſtances: Firſt, the place where he
<pb facs="tcp:178039:3"/> was called, which was Iericho, ſecondly, the perſon that was called, Zaccheus the Publican. Thirdly, by whom &amp; how he was called, by the voyce of Chriſt. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the effect and fruit of his calling, his good confeſſion.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="circumstance">
                     <head>The firſt circumſtance.</head>
                     <p>Firſt therefore for the place where he was conuerted, it appeareth to be Jericho, a citie not farre diſtant from Jeruſalem. It was ſomtime a notable Citie, till it was <note place="margin">Ioſu. 6.</note> ſubuerted and ruinated by the Lords Champion Joſua. <note place="margin">1. Reg. 16. 34.</note> It was builded againe in the dayes of Ahab, by Hiel the Bethelite, and remaineth at this day with the reſt of that holy Land, vnder the Turkiſh Empire. Vnto this Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo, the Lord of heauen and earth vouchſafeth to come in the likenes of a ſeruant. And as Ioſua co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed Iericho ſeauen times minding to deſtroy it, ſo Chriſt the true Ioſua, reſorted oftentimes to Iericho, minding to ſaue it. But as in the deſtruction of Iericho, Ioſua ſpared none but Rahab the harlot: ſo Ieſus in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Iericho conuerted none but Zaccheus the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican. When Ioſua had conquered and raced Iericho, he ſowed ſalt in it to make it barren, and curſed him that ſhould attempt to build it vp: yet in this barren ſoile Chriſt hath his ſpirituall haiueſt, and in this curſed Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he hath a holy Temple, a bleſſed building. Samaria that wicked city, affordeth many that beleeue in Chriſt. Iohn 4. 39. And out of Galile, from whence they thought no good thing might come, Iohn 1. verſe 46. Chriſt called diuers of his Apoſtles; and euen in Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho <note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 52.</note> this curſed Citie, Chriſt hath a rich man that is to be ſaued. In euery place Chriſt hath his choſen. There is neither Iew nor Gentile, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free, but Chriſt is all in all, to all that call vpon him, Rom. 10. 12.</p>

                     <head>The ſecond circumſtance.</head>
                     <p>Now followeth the deſcription of Zaccheus, which is moſt plainly &amp; fully ſet foorth vnto vs. The holy ghoſt ſpeaking of Zaccheus and his conuerſion, comes in with an <hi>Ecce,</hi> Behold, as if it were a wonder that Zaccheus ſhould be conuerted: Zaccheus was a Gentile, a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, and a rich man, and therefore behold a myracle, as if in the conuerſion of Zaccheus, theſe three ſhould be conuerted at once.</p>
                     <p>Zaccheus was a Gentile; a maruell to ſee a Gentile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Iew, that is, to beleeue in Chriſt. Hee was a <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 28.</note> principall Publican; a ſtrange thing to ſee a chiefe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomer to giue ouer his office: and he was rich alſo; a rare matter to ſee a rich man to enter into the kingdome of God: and therefore behold a miracle, as if at this day the Turke, Pope, and the King of Spaine, were at once <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 28.</note> perſwaded to forſake their idolatry and ſuperſtition. Chriſt going to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> conuerteth a Gentile, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the calling of the Gentiles: he conuerteth a publican, to ſhew that notorious ſinners may hope to bee ſaued, if they repent and amend, as Zaccheus did. He conuerteth a rich man, to ſhew that al rich men are not excluded from the kingdome of heauen.</p>
                     <p>He was called Zaccheus before his conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but hee was neuer truely called Zaccheus till Chriſt called him ſo. His name ſignifying, ſimple, pure, honeſt; but his life was ſubtill, impure, and moſt deteſtable. Thus many are called by honeſt names, whoſe deedes be wray their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt natures, and vices oftentimes are ſhrowded in the habits of vertue, like Aeſopes Aſſe, masking in the Lions skinne, till his long eares detect his follie, or like the Crowe that is deckt in others plumes, till euery bird doe plucke his feather.
<pb facs="tcp:178039:4"/> Zaccheus by his profeſſion was a Publican, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much deteſted of the Iewes: for Publicans were Roman officers, appointed to gather and receiue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique cuſtome or tribute of the Iewes, who were at that time in ſubiection to the Romanes. And amongſt theſe Officers, Zaccheus was the chiefe, and (as it ſeemeth) Ouerſeer of the reſt that were in <hi>Iericho,</hi> and therefore in chiefe hatred among the Iewes, as one that chiefely fauoured the Romans tyranny, and ſerued to abridge their country liberty, which ought not to be ſubiect to any Nation.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, he contemned the ceremonies of the Iewes, and regarded not their religion, nor liued after their law, and therefore with the reſt of the heathen Publicans, was excommunicate out of their ſynagogue, Matth. cha. 18.</p>
                     <p>Thus was he hated for his profeſſion, becauſe he was a Publican, and for his religion, becauſe he was a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. Yet was he beloued for his wealth, for rich men haue many friendes, Prou. 14. 20. And though they doe neuer ſo wickedly, yet haue they ſome to take their parts. If they ſpeak neuer ſo proudly, yet are there ſome to praiſe their ſaying, Eccle. 13. 23. 24.</p>
                     <p>Zaccheus was a Publican, and therefore rich: for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans muſt needes be rich, and vſurers will be wealthy. But rich Publicans make poore Princes, and wealthy vſurers make many beggars. In euery prouince there were many Publicans, and therefore much poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in euery place: for where there be many caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, the fruit is ſoone conſumed; &amp; where there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extortioners, beggars muſt needs abound.</p>
                     <p>By the Law of God, there might be no beggars in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, but when ſo many Publicans were ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <note place="margin">Deut. 15.</note> tribute of the Iewes contrary to Gods lawe, no maruell though ſo many ſate and begged, contrary to Gods lawe, Luke 18. Iohn 9. Acts 3. By the lawe of
<pb facs="tcp:178039:4"/> God, there ought to be no beggars among Chriſtians, Pſal. 32. 25. But when ſo many vſurers are tollerated in a chriſtian common-wealth, contrary to the Lawe of Chriſt, Luke 6. 35. no maruell though we haue ſo many beggars, contrary to the minde of Chriſt. <hi>The poore</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Leu. 35. 36. 37. Mark 14. 7.</note> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>yee ſhall haue alwaies with you, but when you will, you may doe them good:</hi> and we ſhall be ſure to haue the poore amongſt vs alwaies, but we muſt make ſuch good prouiſion for them, that they be not faine to beg <note place="margin">Pſal. 3 7.</note> their bred.</p>
                     <p>Thus was Zaccheus rich to himſelfe, for hee was a Publican, but hee was rich toward God alſo, for he had a deſire to ſee Chriſt. Almighty God, <hi>who is rich in mercie,</hi> Ephe. 2. hath ſo inſpired his heart with the deſire of heauenly riches, that whereas before his whole delight was in ſeeking of worldly wealth, now his greateſt care is to ſeeke for heauenly treaſure. Hee now forgetteth what his profeſſion is, &amp; begins to be of a new profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and hee whoſe heart was wholly ſet vpon earthly profit, is now like olde <hi>Simeon,</hi> moſt deſirous to ſee his Sauiour. The Tetrarch Herod deſired to ſee Chriſt, and deſpiſed him when he ſaw him, Luk. 23. 8. 11. but Zaccheus the publican deſired to ſee Chriſt, &amp; reioyced when he ſaw him, like Abraham that deſired to ſee the day of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8 56. And therefore of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of Sathan, Zaccheus is now become the childe of Abraham, which reioyced to ſee the day of Chriſt. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py were his eyes that ſaw ſo bleſſed a ſight, for many <note place="margin">Luk. 10.</note> Prophets and righteous men haue deſired to ſee and to heare thoſe things that Zaccheus both ſaw and heard, and could not ſee nor heare the ſame. If Iacob thought himſelfe happy, if that he might but ſee his ſonne <hi>Ioſeph</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note> before his death, then ſurely thrice happy Zaccheus, whoſe hap it was, not onely to ſee (as Iacob did) but to reioyce (as Mary did) in Chriſt his Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>As Zaccheus was deſirous to ſee Chriſt in earth, ſo I
<pb facs="tcp:178039:5"/> would haue the rich men of our time, deſirous to ſee Chriſt in heauen. For although with the eyes of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy we cannot ſee chriſt as <hi>Zaccheus</hi> did, yet with the eies of our faith we may behold him as Stephen did, Acts 7. But if our faith be ſo weake ſighted that we cannot ſee Chriſt, yet let vs haue a deſire to hear chriſt in his word, whereby our faith may be increaſed, for faith comes by <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 1. Reg. 10.</note> hearing the word of God. And as the Queene of the South deſired to heare the wiſdome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſo let vs be deſirous to heare the wiſdome of Chriſt our Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Salomon</hi> left ſome Bookes in writing, wherein is ſeene ſome part of his wiſedome; and Chriſt our king, <note place="margin">Iohn 20. 31.</note> hath left vnto vs his moſt ſacred word, as it were a taſte of his wiſedome, ſufficient matter for our ſaluation, this is that heauenly foode, Mat. 4. 4. whereby our ſoules are fed vnto eternall life, let vs therfore labour for that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly foode: and as the Iſraelites were carefull to gather Manna to ſuſtaine their bodies, ſo let vs be as carefull to heare the word to feede our ſoules. The people in the <note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> time of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 24. tooke great paines to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt both by land and ſea, and many now adaies (I confeſſe) are very forward to follow his faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but as they followed Chriſt ſo faſt to fill their bellies, ſo theſe frequent Sermons for faſhion to ſerue the time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zaccheus</hi> is deſirous to ſee Chriſt, a godly care, but yet he could not obtaine his purpoſe: a thing common; for <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 26.</note> euery one that hath anie good motion, hath alwaies ſome hinderance to croſſe the ſame; and Zaccheus hath a double impediment to hinder his honeſt enterpriſe: The preaſe of the people, and his little ſtature. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the former, that is, the multitude, is alwayes wont to <note place="margin">Two impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</note> be an enemie to thoſe that would come to Chriſt. This hindred the blind man from receiuing his ſight, Luk. 18. for the people rebuked him that hee ſhould holde his peace, till Chriſt called him and opened his eyes. This
<pb facs="tcp:178039:5"/> hindred them that brought the man ſick of the Paulſie, Mar. 2. for they could not come at Chriſt for the preaſe, till they vncouered the roofe of the houſe, and let down the bed wherein the ſicke of the Paulſie lay.</p>
                     <p>This hindered the healing of the deafe and dumbe, Mar. 7. till Chriſt tooke him aſide out of the multitude, and cured him. This hindered the raiſing of the Rulers daughter, Matth. 9. till Chriſt had thruſt out the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrells and the multitude, and then reſtored the maid to life. Finally, this hindered Zaccheus here from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto Chriſt, till Chriſt vouchſafed to call him to himſelfe. Thus alwaies a multitude that is prone to euill, doth withdraw and hinder vs from approching vnto Chriſt: and therefore we muſt not follow a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to doe euill, nor decline after many, to ouerthrow the trueth. Exod. 23.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond impediment that hindereth Zaccheus from ſeeing Chriſt, is his little ſtature. He was ſo low of ſtature, that he could not ſee Chriſt aboue the multitude: but Chriſt was aboue the multitude, and therefore could ſee Zaccheus though he were ſo low of ſtature. For God looketh not on the countenance, nor on the height of <note place="margin">2. Sam. 16. 7. 1. Sam. 16. 12.</note> mans ſtature, but the Lord beholdeth the heart, and preferred little Dauid before Eliab his eldeſt brother, becauſe hee findeth in him a better heart to ſerue the Lord. And <hi>Zaccheus</hi> in his little bodie, hath a heart and minde prepared to ſeeke and ſee the Lord. <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was ſo low, that hee could not ſee Chriſt: but many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs are ſo high that they will not ſee Chriſt. The common people in time of Chriſt were ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to follow Chriſt, that neither lameneſſe nor blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nor ſicknes, could ſtay them from comming to him; but the common people in our time, are more readie to follow their ſport and paſtime, then to come to the church to heare of Chriſt. And as for our rich men, who ſeeth not that they will make great haſte to ſee a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb facs="tcp:178039:6"/> but will ſearce come out of doores to heare a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?</p>
                     <p>They come to Church as Nichodemus came to Chriſt, <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 2.</note> by night, as if they were aſhamed to come to Church: but they runne after profit, to get riches, as Gehezi ran <note place="margin">2. King. 5.</note> after Naaman the Syrian to get a bribe.</p>
                     <p>Thus hath Zaccheus two lets that he could not ſee Chriſt, the one in the people, the other in himſelfe: and we haue many lets to with-draw vs from Chriſt, ſome are externall, and without vs, as the inticements of the world, and ſome are internall and within vs, as the luſts of our owne fleſh. The preaſe of the people hindereth <note place="margin">Eſay 59. 2.</note> Zaccheus from ſeeing Chriſt in his humility, &amp; the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of our ſinnes doe preſſe vs downe, that we cannot ſee Chriſt in glory. Zaccheus was a man of little ſtature, and that hindered him from ſeeing Chriſt in earth; and we are men of little faith, and that is the cauſe we cannot behold Chriſt in heauen.</p>
                     <p>Though <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was a man of little ſtature, yet it appeareth that he was not a man of little wit. For when he could not come to the ſight of Chriſt for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he had the wit to runne before, and to climbe vp into a tree to obtaine his purpoſe. And for the moſt part it falleth out, that men of low ſtature, are men of high conceit, and the ſhorteſt bodies, haue the ſharpeſt wits, God ſo prouiding, that the defects of their bodies might bee ſupplied with the gifts of their minde. Now Zaccheus that before was loth to moue his foote from the cuſtome-houſe, for loſing his profit, begins to run after Chriſt for feare of a greater loſſe, like Eliza that left his plowing, and ranne after Elias to follow his new vocation. But Zaccheus doth not only runne, but alſo climbe vp into a tree to ſee Chriſt: A ſtrange thing that Zaccheus a rich man, and a chiefe cuſtomer, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue <note place="margin">1. Reg 19.</note> himſelfe ſo childiſhly in the ſight of ſo great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; but the deſire he had to ſee Chriſt, made him
<pb facs="tcp:178039:6"/> forget himſelfe: and to commit ſuch things as were not fitting for his ſtate and credit. So they that will follow <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> Chriſt, muſt make account to doe many things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the faſhion of the world, and their owne liking. If Chriſt himſelfe were content to leaue the glory which he had with his Father to come downe to us, ſhall not wee bee content to leaue the reputation which wee haue with men to goe vp to him?</p>
                     <p>But alas, where is there any almoſt that preferreth not the fruition of this earthly priſon, before the poſſeſſion of that heauenly manſion? and had rather hazard the hope which they haue of eternall glory, then leeſe the preſent enioying of their fading pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The ambitious man hunteth after honour, and will not leeſe an inch of his eſtimation. The couetous man <note place="margin">Iohn 12. 6.</note> ſeekes after profit, and counts (like Iudas,) all loſt that comes not to his bagges. And the voluptuous man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes his time in pleaſure, and thinketh that his cheefe felicitie. Thus euery man makes his heauen of that wherein he moſt delighteth, and is content to take great paines to accompliſh his fond deſires. But heere Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus is of an other mind; for beeing a publike officer, he climbes into a tree, which ſtood not with his grauitie, and beeing a rich man, he runs to ſee Chriſt, which was not for his worldly profit; yea he takes great pains to ſee Chriſt, not reſpecting his caſe or pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Thus muſt we bee affected if wee deſire to come to Chriſt, that neither honours, nor preferments, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, nor pleaſure, nor kindred, nor friends, be able to hold vs backe: We muſt be ready, not onely to runne, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to climbe (if need require) as <hi>Zaccheus</hi> did: that is, to take ſome paine and trauaile to haue a ſight of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Queene of the South vndertooke a great and <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 22. Luke 14. 29. 1. King. 10.</note> tedious iourney to heare the wiſedome of Salomon, but we are loath to take any paine to heare one that is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Salomon.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:178039:7"/>
                     <p>The people in Dauids time brought ſo much trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſo many gifts to the building of Gods Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the Prieſts were faine to bid them ceaſe: but a <note place="margin">1. Chro. 29. 9.</note> great part of the people in our time, are ſo ſparing of their paines and coſt, that they thinke that very time miſſpent which is employed in the ſeruice of God; and that mony ill beſtowed, which is giuen to the maintenance of his Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Zaccheus</hi> could not ſee Chriſt for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude hee climbes into a tree, that groweth in the way where he was to paſſe, that from a tree he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, which was to ſuffer on a tree for mans ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So when we cannot draw neere to Chriſt, by reaſon of our ſinnes that preſſe vs downe, we will climbe vp by a liuely faith, which is the tree of life, that groweth in the way to eternall life, that ſo, with the eies of our faith, wee may behold him that died for our ſinnes vpon a tree.</p>
                     <p>It was a wilde Figge tree that <hi>Zaccheus</hi> climbed, but not like that vnfruitfull one which our Sauiour cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for this bare moſt pretious fruite, euen ſuch as <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 1</note> Chriſt himſelfe vouchſafed to pluck. A happy tree that bare ſuch pretious fruite as Zaccheus was; but thrice happy Zaccheus, that ſo happily climbed on that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py tree.</p>
                     <p>This tree grew in the way that Chriſt was to paſſe, for elſe Zaccheus might haue climbed to no purpoſe: So if we deſire to find Chriſt, we muſt ſeeke him in the way where he hath promiſed to ſhew himſelfe vnto vs, that is, in his holy Temple; where his word is duely preached, and his Sacraments reuerently adminiſtred, for where <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 20.</note> two or three are gathered together, he hath promiſed to be preſent amongſt them.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>When Chriſt came to the place, hee locked vp and ſaw Zaccheus.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>As Zaccheus ranne before Chriſt, ſo Chriſt followed after to ſee <hi>Zaccheus.</hi> Sathan for his part <hi>went about like</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8. Iohn 10. Luke 11. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>a roaring Lyon, ſeeking to deuoure him;</hi> but Chriſt for his part goeth about like a good ſheepheard, minding to ſaue him. And although Sathan a ſtrong armed man had taken ſome poſſeſſion in the heart of <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> yet Chriſt a ſtronger then hee commeth vnarmed, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from him his harneſſe wherein he truſted, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cueth the ſpoile.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt commeth to the place where Zaccheus was, becauſe otherwiſe it had bin vnpoſſible for Zaccheus to come to his preſence: for vnleſſe the Lord vouchſafe to come vnto vs, wee cannot attaine to the preſence of God. As no man might haue any acceſſe to king Aſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus except he ſtretched out his golden ſcepter: ſo no <note place="margin">Heſter 4.</note> man may come to Chriſt, vnleſſe he be called by the golden ſcepter of his ſacred word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chriſt looked vp and ſaw Zaccheus,</hi> before <hi>Zaccheus</hi> could looke downe to behold him. Thus doth the Lord preuent vs with his mercy, whom he might caſt off in his iuſtice: and if he perceiue in vs a willing mind to come vnto him, he is content to come firſt vnto vs. And like that good father, Luke 15. to behold vs while wee are yet a great way off, and to haue compaſſion on vs.</p>
                     <p>When Iobs three friends that came to viſit him in his <note place="margin">Iob. 2. 12.</note> great calamitie lift vp their eies a farre off, they knew not <hi>Iob,</hi> becauſe he was ſo ſore afflicted. But Chriſt who is the mirour of true friendſhip, cannot ſo ſoone forget his friends, howſoeuer they be diſguiſed. He knoweth his owne ſheep whereſoeuer he ſeeth them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:178039:8"/> they be vnder the Figge-tree, as Nathaniel was, or vpon the Figgetree, as <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was, he hath reſpect vnto them. And if they haue a deſire to ſeeke they ſhall bee ſure to find, Math. 7. And if they labour &amp; are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy laden, hee will refreſh them, Math. 11. Chriſt is now come to the place where <hi>Zaccheus</hi> is to be called; and as Abraham, Gen. 22. lift vp his eyes and ſaw in the buſh a ramme that was to be ſactificed, ſo Chriſt lifting vp his eies, ſaw in the tree. Zaccheus the ſinner that was to be conuerted. And now beginnes the conuerſion of Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, for now Chriſt begins to ſpeake vnto him.</p>
                     <p>Zaccheus deſired onely to ſee Chriſt, but now Chriſt calleth him by name, and offereth his owne ſelfe vnto him. This was more then Zaccheus expected, and yet no more than Chriſt vouchſafeth, namely, to giue more <note place="margin">Iohn 1. Luke 5. 1. Kin. 3. 12. 13 Gen. 28. 20.</note> then is deſired. The ſicke of the palſie that asked health, obtained alſo forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. <hi>Salomon</hi> deſired wiſedom, and the Lord gaue him wiſedome, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wealth beſide. Iacob asked but meate and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and God made him a great rich man. And Zacche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us deſired only to haue a ſight of Chriſt, and was ſo happy as to entertaine him into his houſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Lord that is rich in mercy to all that call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, vſeth oftentimes to giue more then wee aske: and hee that is alwaies found of them that ſeeke him <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 12. Epheſ. 2. 4. Ior. 29.</note> with their whole heart, is found alſo ſometime of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that knew not God, Eſay, 65. 1. Let vs therefore that were ſometimes ſinners of the Gentiles, ſeeke the Lord as Zaccheus did, while he may be found, and call vpon him while he is nigh. Hee will be found of them that ſeeke him hartily, and is nigh to all them that cal vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 20. Eſay. 55.</note> him faithfully, Pſal. 145. 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zaccheus, come downe at once.</hi> Now Chriſt beginnes to call Zaccheus from the tree to be conuerted, as God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Adam from among the trees of the garden to be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Gen. 3. Before, Zaccheus was too low, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:178039:8"/> was faine to climbe, but now he is too high, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt come downe. And we (for the moſt part) are either too high, or too low, too hote, or too colde, too quick, or too ſlothfull in the Lords buſineſſe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time we flocke together to heare a Sermon, like the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Luke 5. that preſſed vpon Chriſt to heare the word, and anon we run to ſee ſome pleaſant paſtime, like the <note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> Athenians, whoſe eares alwaies itched to heare ſome newes.</p>
                     <p>Who make more ſhew of conſcience and religion, then they that ſhew themſelues moſt irreligious and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable? Who ſeemed more confident and vertuous in <note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> Chriſt his cauſe then <hi>Peter?</hi> and not long after, who more traiterous and faint hearted?</p>
                     <p>Many can ſay with <hi>Peter,</hi> that they will not ſtick to die before they will denie Chriſt; but when it comes to the triall, they are ready to abiure Chriſt and his religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will hazard either life or liuing.</p>
                     <p>He that will come to Chriſt, muſt come at once, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, for delayes (ſpecially in the matter of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation) are moſt dangerous, and repentance may not be deferred. <hi>Wee muſt make no tarrying to turne vnto the Lord, nor put off from day to day. leſt the wrath of the Lord</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>breake foorth ſuddenly, and wee bee deſtroyed in our ſecurity, and periſh in the time of vengeance.</hi> When the Lord is min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do vs good, he will haue vs come quickly, like Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Geneſis 45. 9. that in the time of famine would haue his father Iacob to come downe quickly vnto him, to ſoiourne in Egypt, where there was ſome plentie of foode.</p>
                     <p>As the children of this world are very nimble to worke wickednes, ſo the children of light ſhould be as nimble to follow goodnes. Iudas was nimble to betray Chriſt, Iohn 13. 27. and the bad debtors, Luke 16. could ſit downe quickly to miſ-reckon their creditor: ſo let vs come quickly to heare of Chriſt, that Chriſt may accept
<pb facs="tcp:178039:9"/> of vs quickly; let vs be nimble to make our accompt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we do not (like the fooliſh builder) come ſhort of our reckoning. <note place="margin">Luke 14. 28.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But why muſt Zaccheus come downe ſo haſtily? Euen to entertaine Chriſt into his houſe: <hi>For to day</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I muſt abide with thee.</hi> This was ioyfull news to little Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus. Not long before, he wanted meanes to ſee Chriſt, but now he hath opportunity to entertaine him into his houſe.</p>
                     <p>There was more humanity in Chriſt then in Zacche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: for if Chriſt had not bidden himſelfe to dinner, he had not bin bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Zaccheus: So if Chriſt do not offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <note place="margin">Mat. 35. 40.</note> vnto vs in his afflicted members, he may go long i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before we will offer him any entertainement. As often as the poore craueth any reliefe at our hands, let vs imagine that Chriſt asketh ſomething of vs: but as Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus muſt entertain him preſently without delay, ſo let vs be ready to helpe them preſently, becauſe they ſtand in neede of preſent helpe. And as he muſt receiue Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his houſe; ſo we muſt make account to receiue his nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy members into our houſes. And as the vniuſt ſteward <note place="margin">Luke 6.</note> procureth himſelfe friends with his maſters goods, ſo let vs make the poore to be our friends, by our benificence and bounty towards them, that ſo receiuing them, (when they haue need) into our earthlie houſes, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs when we ſtand in greateſt need, into euerlaſting habitations.</p>
                     <p>They that were inuited to the marriage, Matth. 22, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to come; but Chriſt is content to come to Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus houſe before he was inuited. Wherein alſo he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth his great humility, in comming before he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, as they be wrayed their great arrogancy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to come beeing ſolemnly bidden. It was a part of great humility, that he that was moſt free from ſinne, would vouchſafe to come into a ſinners houſe: but it was a ſigne of great humility, that hee would be wray his
<pb facs="tcp:178039:9"/> great neceſſitie, and ſeeke for ſuccour at a ſinners hand.</p>

Here therefore appeareth the ſingular humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and great humility of Chriſt to ſinfull men: he offereth himſelfe to betheir gueſt, if he find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willing to intertain him for their gueſt, And Zaccheus no doubt was willing to entertain him, for although Chriſt heard not the voice, yet he heard the affection of Zaccheus inuiting him to dinner.</p>
                     <p>As therefore Zaccheus was willing to receiue Chriſt into his houſe, ſo let vs be ready to receiue him into our hearts. For as Chriſt ſaid to Zaccheus, <hi>This day I muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide at thy houſe:</hi> ſo he ſaith to euery one of vs. <hi>This day I muſt abide in your hearts.</hi> Wherefore as the prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid <note place="margin">Pſal. 24.</note> ſaith, <hi>Open your gates that the King of glory may come in:</hi> ſo I ſay vnto you, <hi>Open your hearts, that the word of God may enter in.</hi> This day the word of God may abide in your hearts, for this day the word is preached vnto you; and who knoweth whether hee ſhall liue to heare it the next Sabbath: <hi>To day therefore if you will heare his voyce, harden not your hearts,</hi> as did the Iſraelites, leſt if you har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <note place="margin">Pſal. 95.</note> your hearts, his voyce be heard no more amongſt you.</p>
                     <p>This day you may gather this heauenly Manna, as the Iſraelites might gather their Manna ſix daies together, <note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note> but to morrow (perhaps) and ſixe daies after, you may
<pb facs="tcp:178039:10"/> not gather it, as on the ſeauenth day Manna might not be found.</p>
                     <p>The Lord grant that you may gather ſufficient foode for the ſuſtentation of your ſoules, that as Elias the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet iournied in the ſtrength of the meate that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell brought him, euen vnto Horeb the mount of God: ſo you in the ſtrength of this ſpirituall meat which heere <note place="margin">1.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou heard the laſt Sabboth, how <hi>Zaccheus</hi> the Publican was called to be a Chriſtian: now you ſhal heare the fruit of his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. No ſooner had Chriſt called him from the tree, but that he came downe haſtily, &amp; receiued him ioyfully.</p>
                  <p>This was the fruit which it had in the heart of <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi> namely obedience to the voyce of Chriſt: a fruit
<pb facs="tcp:178039:11"/> more pretious and acceptable vnto God, than the moſt pleaſant fruits which Eden yeelded; and a ſacrifice more ſweet &amp; acceptable vnto him, than al the ſacrifices which the Law required. This is the ſacrifice wherewith the Lord is pleaſed, euen when his voyce is obeyed, 1. Sam. 16 22. The voice of the Lord is a glorious voyce, &amp; mighty in operation, diuiding the flames of fire, &amp; ſhaking the <note place="margin">Pſal. 29.</note> cedar trees. So the voyce of Chriſt is a glorious voyce, his voice is mighty in operation, diuiding the ſoule and the <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> ſpirit, and ſhaking <hi>Zaccheus</hi> from the wild figge-tree, whereinto he had climbed.</p>
                  <p>The ſame God to whoſe command the windes, the ſea, the diuels, and death it ſelfe obey, heere comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Zaccheus</hi> to come down at once, and he commeth downe haſtily to receiue him into his houſe, and hee receiueth him ioyfully. As Zaccheus could not come at Chriſt till he was called, ſo no man can come to Chriſt <note place="margin">Iohn 6. 44.</note> except the Father draw him: And as Zaccheus could not chooſe but come, when he was called by the voice of Chriſt, ſo when any man is called effectually by the preaching of the Goſpel, he cannot chooſe but come to Chriſt: for where there is an effectuall calling, there is grace giuen alſo to obey the ſame, Rom. 8. 30. The Lord is faine ſometime to call vs often, becauſe we know not the voyce of him that calleth vs, as he called Samuel three times before hee anſwered; becauſe at that time Samuel knew not the Lord, 1. Sam. 3. 7. But as ſoone as he vnderſtood that it was the Lord that ſpake vnto him, he replied preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, <hi>Speak on Lord, for thy ſeruant hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi> So when the Lord calleth any man effectually by the preaching of his word, all the parts and powers of his body doe yeeld their obedience, the care liſteneth, the tongue confeſſeth, the heart beleeueth, the head de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſeth, the hand performeth, the foote runneth, the eye directeth, and all concurre <hi>To doe thy will O God,</hi> P. ſalme. 40. 7.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:178039:11"/>
                  <p>Such and ſo effectuall is the voyce of Chriſt in the hearts of his choſen, that it maketh Saul of a bloody per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor to become Paul a painefull Preacher: it cauſeth <note place="margin">Acts 9. Math. 4.</note> Peter of a ſilly Fiſherman, to become a catcher of men: and Zaccheus here of a vile Publican, to become a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Chriſtian. And ſuch alſo is the nature of the word preached, whereſoeuer it pleaſeth the Lord to giue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and encreaſe thereto, that it is able to tranſforme the minds of men, to beget faith in the harts of Jnfidels, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 7.</note> and (in a word) to ſaue ſuch as are ordained to eternall life. Acts 13. This is the power of the word of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to cauſe a conſenting to the truth thereof; and this is the property of the children of God, to yeeld all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> to the word of God. As ſoone as Chriſt calleth Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, he comes downe preſently, like the light in the creation, that was made as ſoone as God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light.</hi> Heere therefore of Zaccheus that obeyed the voyce of Chriſt, let vs learne obedience to the voice of Chriſt: ſor as Chriſt biddeth Zaccheus to come downe, becauſe he was too high: ſo he ſaith to euery one of vs, <hi>Come downe,</hi> becauſe we are too high minded. But with vs the voice of Chriſt is not ſo effectuall as it was with Zaccheus: for he was content to come downe at the firſt bidding: but we muſt be often bidden, to beware of pride &amp; ambition, and yet we wil ſtil be climbing. There are few ſo high that are content with their calling, but as Haman was alwaies aſpiring till he came to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <note place="margin">Heſt 7.</note> ſo many amongſt vs are alwaies climbing till they catch a fall.</p>
                  <p>Againe, as Chriſt ſaid to Zaccheus, <hi>To day I muſt abide at thy houſe:</hi> So Chriſt ſaith to vs, To day my poor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted members ſhould receiue ſome ſuccour at your hands. But as the Prieſt and the Leuite, Luke 10. paſſed by the wounded man leauing him halfe dead, ſo we (for the moſt part) paſſe by our needy brethren, leauing them vnreliued. Thus are we euery way diſobedient to the
<pb facs="tcp:178039:12"/> voice of Chriſt. He teacheth vs to be humble as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is, Matth. 11. 29. and we waxe proud and inſolent as Satan is. Hee willeth vs to be mercifull, as our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father is, Luke 6. 36. and we are cruell and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull, as the rich Glutton was, Luke 16. This is the cauſe why the earth deceiueth and rendreth not her fruit, Eſay 24. 5. This is the cauſe why the ſword de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth abroad, and the peſtilence deſtroyeth at home, Deut. 28. 15. Leuit. 26. 24. 25. and in a word, this is the cauſe of all the miſchiefes and calamities that are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, euen becauſe we are obſtinate and rebellious againſt the Lord, we are vndutifull and diſobedient to the voice of Chriſt, that calleth vs ſo louingly to come vnto him, Math. 11. 28.</p>
                  <p>Zaccheus was called but once, &amp; he commeth quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but we are called oftentimes, and almoſt euery day, and that by the voyce of Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>For hee that heareth you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) Luke. 10. 16. <hi>heareth mee:</hi> and yet we cannot find the way to Chriſt. The word of God, which is the lanterne vnto our feete, and the light vnto our paths, Pſalm. 119. hath beene plainely and plentifully preached amongſt vs theſe many yeers, and yet many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt vs haue not yet learned to come to Chriſt. <hi>Zacche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> comes quickly when Chriſt calleth him, let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learne of Zaccheus to come quickly when Chriſt calleth vs. We muſt be quicke in the Lords buſines, for God cannot abide loyterers ſtanding al the day idle, Mat. 20. and as he loueth a cheerfull giuer, 2. Cor. 9. 7. ſo he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a cheerfull follower.</p>
                  <p>It followeth therefore that Zaccheus receiued him cheerefully. Still Zaccheus is a receiuer: before he was a receiuer of cuſtome, now he is a receiuer of Chriſt. Zaccheus receiued Chriſt two waies: firſt into his heart, when he deſired to ſee him: and then into his houſe when he gaue him hoſpitalitie. Many receiued Chriſt to houſe, but not into their hearts, and therefore receiued
<pb facs="tcp:178039:12"/> him grudgingly: but Zaccheus receiued Chriſt firſt into his heart, and then into his houſe; and therefore receiued him ioyfully. Of Zaccheus his ioyfulneſſe, we muſt learne to be ioyfull when we do any thing for the cauſe of Chriſt: we muſt be glad to harbour Chriſt in his members, as Zaccheus was glad to harbour Chriſt himſelfe. As before in comming downe from the tree, Zaccheus ſhewed his obedience: ſo heere in receiuing Chriſt into his houſe, he ſheweth the loue that he bare vnto him. If Zaccheus had not loued Chriſt, he might haue ſent him to ſome common Inne: But Zaccheus is content to receiue Chriſt in his owne houſe; yea he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth to haue gotten ſo good a gueſt; like Abraham, <note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> that vſed to ſit at the doore of his tent, and reioyced to entertaine ſtrangers that went by the way: and therefore, though Zaccheus were a Gentile borne, yet herein he ſheweth himſelfe the child of Abraham, becauſe he doth the works of Abraham, Ioh 8. ver. 39. So did Abraham, and ſo we muſt doe, if we will ſhew our ſelues to be the children of Abraham.</p>
                  <p>When Abraham thought only to haue entertained <note place="margin">Abraham. Gen. 18. 3.</note> men, he receiueth the Angels in the ſhape and likeneſſe of men: and when Zaccheus thought to entertaine the ſonne of man, he receiueth the ſonne of God himſelfe. Let vs therefore (as the Apoſtle willeth vs.) Hebr. 13. 2. be mindfull to entertaine ſtrangers, for as much as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Lot. Gen. 19. 3.</note> ſome haue receiued Angels into their houſes vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares; and why ſhould we not hope to entertaine the like, or better gueſts, if we be giuen to hoſpitalitie, as thoſe godly Fathers were? For as the Angels came to them in the likenes of men: ſo Chriſt himſelfe comes to vs in the likenes of a poore man, of a lame man, and of a blind man: and when he commeth, he commeth hungry, or thirſty, or naked, or harbourleſſe, or ſicke, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned: and happy are they that feede, or cloath, or harbour or viſite him, when he commeth thus afflicted,
<pb facs="tcp:178039:13"/> When Abraham entertained the Angels, he was not onely buſie himſelfe, but his wife, and all his houſhold were carefull to make prouiſion for them; ſo when Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus receiued Chriſt into his houſe, his whole familie (no doubt) were no leſſe willing and carefull to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Chriſt, then their Maſter was: and therefore not onely to Zaccheus, but euen to his whole houſe ſaluation is promiſed, becauſe the whole family reioyced at Chriſt his comming. Let rich men learne of Zaccheus to entertaine Chriſt in his needy members, and let rich mens ſeruants learne of Zaccheus family, to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues mercifull, like their mercifull maſters, that they may receiue the reward of mercy and hoſpitalitie at the laſt day. <hi>Come ye bleſſed, for I was harbourleſſe, and ye tooke me in.</hi> Generally, as Zaccheus gladly receiued Chriſt: ſo let euery one that is able, be glad to diſtribute to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity <note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> of the poore Saints: if we haue much, let vs giue plentifully: if we haue little let vs giue gladly of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: if wee be not able to giue a penny, yet happily wee may affoord a morſell of bread: if not that, yet there is none ſo needy, that cannot giue a cup of cold water, and euen ſo ſmall a gift ſhall not loſe his iuſt reward, Matth. 10. 41. Zaccheus receiued Chriſt into his heart, but many amongſt vs are ready to driue Chriſt out, and to receiue Sathan inſtead of him: Zaccheus receiued Chriſt into his houſe, but there are many rich men amongſt vs, that like Diues, Luke 16. will not affoord poore Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus the crummes that fall from their table: but as the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell, Acts 12. opened not the doore for ioy when ſhe heard Peters voyce; ſo by contrary, theſe men for verie griefe ſhut their gates, when they perceiue a begger there Finally, Zaccheus was ioyfull when he entertained Chriſt, but many amongſt vs are ſorrowfull when they ſhould relieue the poore, like churliſh Nabal, 1. Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el 25. that reuiled Dauid, when he ſhould haue releeued him.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:178039:13"/>
                  <p>So long as Iob proſpered, hee kept a worthy and a worſhipfull houſe, he ſuffered not the ſtranger to lie in thee ſtreets, but opened his doore to the Trauailer that went by the way, Job. 31, 32. But now many Gentlemen of the country are content to ſuffer the ſtranger, the fatherleſſe, and the widow, not onely to lie but euen to ſtarue and die in the ſtreets with hunger and cold, and neuer receiue them to houſe or harbour, nor affoord them any reliefe or ſuccour. But as the voyce of Abels blood did cry from the earth to God for vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 10.</note> his brothers crueltie: ſo the voyce of the poore and their piteous cries, ſhal enter into the eares of the Lord, and their guiltles blood (which is powred forth in euery place without all compaſſion) ſhall pull downe haſty and ſudden vengeance from heauen vppon the heads of thoſe vnmercifull cormorants, vnleſſe while this time of mercy laſteth, they ſhew mercy to their diſtreſſed neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                  <p>Thus you haue heard how Zaccheus behaued himſelfe in entertaining of Chriſt: now you ſhall ſee the behauiour of the Phariſies in diſdaining at Chriſt. <hi>When all they ſaw it, they murmured ſaying, that he was gone in to lodge with a ſinfull man.</hi> Before, they hated Zaccheus for his vices, becauſe he was couetous: now they enuy him for his vertues, becauſe he was giuen to hoſpitalitie. For the wicked will alwaies haue ſomething to finde fault with in the children of God, like the ſonnes of Iacob, Gen. 37. that hated their brother Ioſeph becauſe of his dreames: and like Saul that vnhappy King, that enuied Dauid for his happy victories, 1. Sam. 18. 29. Thus the wicked when they cannot charge the godly with anie grieuous crime, they beginne to grudge at their well doing: and therefore not onely Zaccheus is hated for receiuing of Chriſt, but Chriſt is hated alſo for beeing his gueſt: When they could not accuſe Chriſt for ſinne, they accuſe him for companying with ſinners: For
<pb facs="tcp:178039:14"/> they muſt ſtill be accuſing ſome or other, for one thing or other, like their father the diuell, that both by name, Reuel. 12. 10. and by nature, Job. 16. 7. is a continuall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of the brethren. It had beene the dutie of the Phariſies to haue receiued Chriſt, and made much of him as <hi>Zaccheus</hi> did: but they are ſo far off from entertaining him themſelues, that it greeueth them to ſee <hi>Zaccheus</hi> giue him entertainment. And ſurely, ſuch is the peruerſe nature of the wicked, that they will neither receiue the grace of God when it is offred them, nor willingly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any other to embrace the ſame: like the wicked Iewes Acts, 13. 50. that would neither beleeue the doctrine which Paul preached, nor could abide that the Gentiles ſhould be brought to the faith of Chriſt. The high Prieſts thought themſelues too high, to haue poore humble Chriſt amongſt them: The Scribes and the Phariſies, in their owne conceit, were too good, too wiſe, and too holy to receiue him into their company and not content to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter and eſtrange themſelues from Chriſt, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained alſo that he ſhould be conuerſant with Publicans and ſinners, as though he were not worthy to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>If it were the office of Chriſt to conuert ſinners, why ſhould the Phariſies be offended at him, if he were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 13.</note> conuerſant with ſinners to work their connerſion. If Chriſt were a Phyſitian to cure the ſickneſſe of the ſoule, that is, to ſaue the people from their ſinnes, why <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 13.</note> ſhould the phariſies murmure at him for keeping of company with <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> that was ſicke in ſoule? for as it is expedient for the Phiſitian to viſit his patients for their better recouery, ſo it was conuenient Chriſt ſhould viſit ſinners for their ſpeedier conuerſion. But as the Phiſitian that reſorteth vnto ſicke perſons, is not ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way infected; ſo the ſoules Phiſitian that conuerſeth with ſinners, is not thereby polluted. And therefore, as Chriſt performed his office though the Phariſies mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured,
<pb facs="tcp:178039:14"/> ſo let the miniſters of God learne by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to performe their duties, though the wicked be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. It was the office of Chriſt to call ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yea, hee came to call Phariſie ſinners as wel as Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican ſinners if the phariſes would haue confeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> to be ſinners, as the Publicans did; but becauſe they ſtood ſo much vpon their owne righteouſneſſe, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed others, therefore Chriſt denounceth ſo many woes againſt them, and preferreth the penitent Publican that <note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> truſted in the Lords mercy, before the proud Phariſie that truſted in his owne merits.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Paul</hi> was a Phariſie, and the ſonne of a pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, yet hee ſhameth not to confeſſe himſelfe one of the <note place="margin">Acts 23. 6.</note> chiefe ſinners that Chriſt came to ſaue. So if the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies that murmured at Zaccheus would haue beene ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they ſhould haue confeſſed themſelues chiefe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as <hi>Paul</hi> did. They ſhould not haue accuſed Chriſt for <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 15.</note> keeping company with ſinners, but they ſhould haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed themſelues for not keeping company with Chriſt. The iuſt man (ſaith Salomon, Pro. 18.) is the firſt accuſer of himſelfe; but the Phariſes are ſo farre from accuſing themſelues that they began to accuſe Zaccheus &amp; Chriſt together. Thus the phariſies of our time that make religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a cloake to couer their corrupt dealing, haue this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to thinke other men to be heinous ſinners, and themſelues only to be righteous: in ſo much as they will not ſticke to ſpeake like that proud people that was wont to ſay, <hi>Depart from me, for I am holier then thou:</hi> and like the preſumptuous phariſie, Luk. 18. <hi>I thank God I am not as others are, extortioners, vſurers, adulterers, dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kards, or ſuch like. I ſanctifie the Sabbath,</hi> which other men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane: I frequent ſermons, which they neglect: J reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the name of God, which they blaſpheme: I pay tith, which others withhold: and faſt oftentimes, which they doe ſeldome, or neuer. Theſe were the ſpeeches of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 7. Luk. 11. 44.</note> that liued in the time of Chriſt, whom hee ſo often
<pb facs="tcp:178039:15"/> calleth hypocrits: and theſe are the ſpeeches of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits of our age, that ſeeme to liue after the ſtraighteſt <note place="margin">Luke 11. 1. Act. 26. 5. Mat. 23. 25. 27</note> ſect of our religion. Acts. 26. They waſh the outſide of the cup and of the platter; that is, they iuſtifie themſelues, and ſeeme maruellous holy in the ſight of men, which can diſcerne by the outward appearance only: but vnto God that ſeeth and ſearcheth the ſecrets of the harts and reines, they appeare like painted toombes, full of dead mens bones, and all filthineſſe: that is, they haue their inward parts full of rauening, and all kinde of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Wherefore, as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your righteouſnes exceed the righteouſnes of the Scribes and Phariſies, you cannot enter into the Kingdome of heauen:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 20.</note> So J ſay vnto you, that except your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſnes of theſe phariſaicall hypocrites, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>Theſe holy phariſies did vſe to call the publicans, not vſurers, nor extortioners, as they themſelues were; but by the generall name of ſinners, as though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were free from ſinne. Thus the Papiſts at this day doe vſe to call the moſt ſincere profeſſors of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, not <hi>Lutherans, Caluiniſts, Zwinglians,</hi> or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as they were wont to call them: but now they terme vs hereticks, a name more odious then any other; whereas in the meane ſeaſon, they themſelues are of all others the greateſt heretickes. So the Atheiſts of our time, when they cannot accuſe the godly that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, of vſurie, or briberie, or extortion, or drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, or any ſuch notorious ſinne, they call them hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, which is the ſumme of all: when as in very trueth they themſelues doe beſt deſerue that name: but it makes no matter what they call vs, neither are wee to be mooued at their deſpightfull ſpeeches: for as the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taunts of theſe murmuring phariſies, could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Zaccheus in his conuerſion, ſo the ſlaunders of theſe godleſſe men, muſt not diſcourage the ſeruants
<pb facs="tcp:178039:15"/> of God from their good profeſſion. The Phariſies did Zaccheus great wrong for calling him ſinner, when hee had repented of his ſinne: and the Atheiſts at this day doe greatly wrong the true profeſſours, in calling them hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, which haue truely repented of their former ſinnes, and endeuour by all good meanes to lead a godly life. Therefore as Zaccheus preferred his ſoules health before all their murmuring: ſo it behooueth vs to looke to our ſoules ſaluation, notwithſtanding all the reproches and ſlanders that are deuiſed againſt vs. And as the Phariſes might call Zaccheus ſinner, but could not hinder his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion: ſo the malicious worldlings may take away our goods, our good names, yea, and our liues alſo, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depriue vs of our ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, as our Sauiour ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>Feare not them that can kill the body, and then can do no more:</hi> ſo I <note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> ſay vnto you, Feare not the frownes of the wicked, for they are not able to hurt your better part: ſeeke not to gaine the fauour of the world, for the whole world is not able to ſaue a ſoule, but feare to offend him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſtroy both body and ſoule in hell, and ſeeke to pleaſe him that is able to ſaue them both in heauen for euer.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth an other fruit of Zaccheus conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: namely his good confeſſion: for, as hee beleeued with his heart vnto righteouſneſſe, ſo he confeſſed with <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> the mouth vnto ſaluation. VVhen Zaccheus was moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the Phariſes, it ſeemeth that hee ſhould ſtoope downe for ſhame: but when he was thus reprooued and reuiled by them, the Scripture ſaith, that hee ſtood vp in ſigne of gladneſſe. As the Apoſtles went away reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that they were counted woorthy to ſuffer rebuke <note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> for the name of Chriſt: ſo Zaccheus the Publican went foorth reioicing, that he was reproched for the cauſe of Chriſt. Before, Zaccheus was a Publican, and therefore ſtood in ſinne very dangerouſly, like the houſe that is
<pb facs="tcp:178039:16"/> builded vpon the ſand, ready to be ouerturned with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tempeſt: but now Zaccheus is become a true chriſtian, <note place="margin">Luke 6. 46.</note> and therefore ſtands in righteouſnes very ſafely; like the houſe that is built vpon a rocke, free from any danger of falling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold Lord, the halfe of my goods, &amp;c.</hi> There are two parts of this confeſſion. The firſt is his gift to the poore: The ſecond is the reſtitution of his vniuſt gotten goods. Before, Zaccheus was an oppreſſor of the poore, now he is a great benefactor to the poore: before, hee was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocher vpon other mens goods; now he is a diſtributer of his owne goods: before, he was a receiuer and a taker, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. Matth. 13.</note> now he is a reſtorer and a giuer: neither doth he giue ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, but he giueth liberally, laying vp a good foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the time to come.</p>
                  <p>Now hath Zaccheus found that pretious pearle, and for ioy thereof, he is content, not to ſell, but to giue all that he hath to enioy the ſame. VVhen the rich Ruler (in the former chapter) was willed to ſell all that he had, &amp; to giue it to the poor, he went away very ſorrowfull, for <note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> he was very rich: but Zaccheus perhaps as rich as he, is content, of his owne accord, and vnbidden, to beſtow halfe his goods vpon the poore, and that with a cheerfull minde. If Zaccheus had giuen only the third part of his goods, no doubt but Chriſt would haue accepted it, for he accepted the widdowes farthing, becauſe it was giuen with a willing mind: but if he had giuen all <note place="margin">Luke 21.</note> his goods to feede the poore, as the Phariſes gaue their almes, to bee ſeene of men: yea, or his body to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as ſome Romans haue done, to get renown, it ſhould haue beene to no purpoſe, becauſe it was done to a wrong <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> end.</p>
                  <p>Now, as Zaccheus was rich in the goods of his life, ſo was he rich in faith alſo: neither was it an idle or dead ſaith that Zaccheus had, but it was a fruitfull and liuely <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> faith, a faith that worketh and laboureth by loue, ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:178039:16"/> as is required at the hands of Chriſtians. Saint Iames ſaith, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes.</hi> And here Zaccheus doth ſhew his faith by his works. Before, he was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in vngodly works, which are the fruites of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: but now he is exerciſed in the works of mercie, which are the fruites of a liuely faith. Zaccheus is very liberall in releeuing the poore, but he is liberall of that which is his owne: ſo there are many now a daies that are very liberall, but it is of that which is none of theirs; for as Nahab and Abihu offred ſtrange fire vnto the Lord, ſo theſe men offer ſtrange goods vnto the Lord, There are ſome amongſt vs, that thinke to make amends <note place="margin">Leuit. 10.</note> for their vniuſt dealing, by giuing part of that to ſome good vſes, which they haue gotten by bad meanes; if they haue gotten a pound by vſury and oppreſſion, they are content perhaps to giue a penny to releeue the poore. But as it was not lawfull for the Iſraelites to bring the price of the hire of an harlot into the houſe of the Lord, ſo it is not lawfull for vs to apply the gaine of our ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goods to the ſeruice of God. <note place="margin">Deut. 23.</note>
                  </p>
                  <q>The halfe of my goods I giue, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Zaccheus ſaith not, I haue giuen as an vpbraider of God: or, I will giue, as a delayer, that meanes to giue away his goods after his death, when he can keepe them no longer: but he ſaith, <hi>I giue,</hi> to ſignifie, that his will is his deede, and that he meaneth not to take any daies of paiment for the matter. For as before he ranne apace to ſee Chriſt, and came downe haſtily to entertain Chriſt in his owne perſon; ſo doth he here giue quickly to releeue Chriſt in his needy members. This is Zaccheus laſt will and Teſtament that he maketh before his death and ſeeth the ſame proued &amp; performed before his eies. If therefore we deſire to doe any good to any of our poore brethren, let vs learne of Zaccheus to do it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly while we are aliue, for time will preuent vs, and death wil preuent vs, I know there would be many that would
<pb facs="tcp:178039:17"/> be willing to giue ſome part of their goods to the poore before their death, as Zaccheus did: but that they know not what neede themſelues may haue thereof before they die; and therfore for the moſt part they will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſake or leaue their goods, till their goods forſake and leaue them. But heerein they ſhew themſelues to doubt of Gods prouidence, and as it were to diſtruſt of his paiment, who hath promiſed to repay whatſoeuer is giuen vnto the poore, as it were lent vnto himſelfe, and that not ſecretly, though they did their almes neuer ſo ſecretly: but the Lord will reward them openly, as our Sauiour ſpeaketh, Matt. 6. The wiſe preacher, Eccl. 11. <note place="margin">Pro. 19. 17.</note> willeth vs to caſt our bread vpon the waters; that is, to be liberall to the poore, whoſe watery eies bewray their great neceſſity: or (as others expound it,) to hazard and aduenture ſome of our goods vpon our needy bretheren, as Merchants do aduenture their goods vpon the ſeas: for although they may ſeeme to bee in great perill and danger of periſhing in the waters, yet commonly it falleth out, that by the bleſſing of God they return with greater profit. So albeit, the reliefe that is beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our diſtreſſed neighbours, may ſeeme to be loſt; yet as the wiſe man ſaith, after a time we ſhall find it again: and as the pretious oile deſcended from Aarons beard to the skirts of his cloathing, ſo certainely the oyle of mercy and charity which we poure into the wounds of <note place="margin">Pſalm. 13 3.</note> our diſtreſſed brethren, ſhall deſcend into our owne ſoules; and as the widdowes oyle was encreaſed in the <note place="margin">Luke 10. 1. King. 17.</note> cruſe, becauſe ſhe releeued the Lords Prophet, ſo ſhall this pretious oyle beſtowed vpon the poore, bee returned vpon our heads in great meaſure. Thus is Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus liberall as you ſee: for he giueth a way halfe his goods, but he giues it not to the rich, that might giue to him againe, but he giues it to the poore that cannot requite him: to teach vs vpon whom we ſhould beſtow our almes. As God that is rich in mercy, giueth all things
<pb facs="tcp:178039:17"/> vnto vs that cannot requite him: ſo the rich men of this world (if they haue any ſpark of mercy in them) ſhould giue vnto the poore that cannot requite them. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs in euery place almoſt, it is farre otherwiſe: for if any thing be to be giuen, not they that are pooreſt and ſtand in greateſt need, but they that can make beſt friends are beſt preferred. Thus Diues is ſtill enriched, and Lazarus is ſtill reiected. If wee ſend to a great man, we ſend an oxe for a preſent, but if we ſend to a poore <note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> man, we ſend a cruſt for an almes. Therefore as Chriſt <note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> ſaid to the Iewes, that the Niniuites ſhould riſe in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them, becauſe they repented at Ionas prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: ſo it may be ſaid vnto vs, that Zaccheus ſhall riſe in iudgement againſt vs, and condemne vs: for he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great mercy vpon the poore, but wee are voide of all compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>Thus you haue heard the firſt part of Zaccheus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, wherein you ſee his liberality to the poore. Now you ſhall heare the ſecond part of his confeſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee promiſeth reſtitution of his vniuſt gotten goods. Before, Zaccheus gaue to the poore the halfe of that which was his owne: now hee reſtoreth that which is none of his, to the right owners. And becauſe hee had detained their goods ſo long, to their great loſſe &amp; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance, therefore he doth not onely reſtore the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, which he had taken from them, but hee alloweth them their coſts and dammages they had ſuſtained. As Ioram King of Iſrael cauſed to bee reſtored to the <note place="margin">2. King. 8.</note> Shunamite her houſe and land, and all the fruites and profites of the ſame, which were wrongfully kept from her ſeauen yeares together: ſo Zaccheus the cuſtomer reſtoreth to thoſe that he had oppreſſed, their goods which he had gotten from them, by fradulent dealing, with all the fruits and profits that might come thereof: during the time of his vniuſt profeſſion. So liberall was Zaccheus to the poore, that hee gaue them halfe his
<pb facs="tcp:178039:18"/> goods: and ſo little got Zaccheus by his vſury and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that for euery penny he reſtored foure. If the vſurers and extortioners of our time would reſtore foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold for that they haue wrongfully gotten. I feare me they would haue but a ſmall halfe to giue to the poore, and but a little left to help themſelues. There was no law to compell Zaccheus to make ſuch reſtitution, except he will confeſſe himſelfe to be a theefe, becauſe he was an vſurer, and then the law of God requireth ſuch reſtitution. And ſurely Zaccheus ſeemeth after a ſort to confeſſe his theft, becauſe he promiſeth foure-fold reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. If a man had ſtolne a ſheepe, the law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that he ſhould reſtore foure ſheepe for one: and the ancient Romans had this law, that vſurers <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 1. 2. Sam. 12.</note> ſhould forfeit foure times ſo much as they tooke for vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. If the ſame law were now to vſe againſt our theeuiſh vſurers, as it was ſometime among them, we ſhould not haue ſuch complaining of the poore both in priſons and ſtreetes. But if theſe great theeues (I meane our biting vſurers) that rob and ſpoile without ceaſing when they haue no neede, might find no more fauour then thoſe petty theeues which rob and ſteale ſometime, when they are driuen thereto by extreme neceſſity, then ſurely the Common-wealth would ſoone be disburdened of that peſtilent brood of caterpillers wherewith it is peſtered. I wiſh them betimes to looke to their owne eſtate, and with Zaccheus to forſake their damnable trade. If they haue liued hitherto by the gaine of vſury, let them now lament their ſinne and call to God for mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe: let them make reſtitution of that they haue wrongfully taken, and grieue that they haue ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that which is none of theirs. For as no ſinne is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned without repentance to God, ſo vſury is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned without repentance to God: and as the ſinne of theft is not remoued, before reſtitution be made to men (if the party be able,) ſo the ſinne of vſury (which is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb facs="tcp:178039:18"/> theft,) is not remitted, before reſtitution be made to thoſe that are oppreſſed and ſpoiled by this ſecret theft. Thus you haue ſeene how Zaccheus that was once a hoorder of his goods, as our rich men are is now a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall diſpoſer of his goods, as I wiſh they were. He that lately was a Camel laden with riches, and therfore vnapt to goe thorow a needles eye, hath now like the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell caſt off his rich lading, and therefore may enter in <note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> at the narrow gate. Some rich men would rather haue loſt their liues, then forgone their goods, and for halfe <note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> that loſſe would haue prooued very penſiue: but this was the ioyfulleſt newes that euer came to Zaccheus houſe, ſweeter to him then all his gold and ſiluer: that whereas before, he was in the ſtate of damnation, now ſaluation is promiſed to him and his houſe: and where as before he was the ſeruant of Satan, now he is become the child of Abraham. Now Zaccheus houſe is become Gods houſe, and Zaccheus himſelfe is the ſon of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; and therefore no cauſe why Chriſt ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to Zaccheus houſe. As Chriſt ſaid to the penitent theefe, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> So he ſaith heere to the penitent Publican, <hi>This day ſaluation is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 13.</note> 
                     <hi>come vnto thy houſe, and this day thou art become the child of Abraham.</hi> Chriſt loueth not to be lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in any mans debt: for as he ſaith to Zaccheus, <hi>To day I muſt abide at thy houſe:</hi> ſo he ſaith to the ſame Zaccheus, To day and hence-forth for euer, thou and thy houſe muſt abide with me in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Here is a happy change in ſtead of a little worldly treaſure, ſubiect to loſſe by theeues, and to ſpoile by ruſt and moths, to haue all ſtore of heauenly treaſure, which neither theeues can ſteale, nor canker can cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: in ſtead of an earthly houſe, ſubiect to fire and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> to haue a houſe giuen of GOD: not made with hands, but eternall in heauen, 2. Cor. 5. 1. Who would not rather chooſe with Zaccheus to giue halfe his goods to the poore, that he may be an heire of ſaluation, and
<pb facs="tcp:178039:19"/> the Son of Abraham to reſt in his, Fathers boſome, than with Diues to keep all from the poor, &amp; be tormented in thoſe eternall flames? That rich glutton that denied the crums from his table, chalenged Abraham for his father, but he was refuſed, becauſe he had not the faith nor works of Abraham: but Zaccheus, though by nature he <note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> were not the child of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet by grace he is become the child of Abraham, becauſe he walked in the ſteps of that faithfull Father. Abraham beleeued before he was <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 39.</note> circumciſed, ſo <hi>Zaccheus</hi> beleeued before he was circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. As Abraham left his countrey and all that he had <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 12.</note> when God called him, ſo <hi>Zaccheus</hi> left his office and the moſt part of his riches, when he was called by the Son of God: &amp; as Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſired to ſee the day of Chriſt, &amp; ſaw it &amp; reioyced; ſo <hi>Zaccheus</hi> deſired to ſee Chriſt, &amp; he ſaw <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 1. Acts 7. 3.</note> him &amp; reioyced. Now is <hi>Zaccheus</hi> a gentile become the child of Abraham, &amp; not only he, but his whole houſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is become the houſe of Abraham; for when Zaccheus <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 56.</note> is conuerted, his whole houſe is conuerted. As the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is, ſuch are the ſeruants; if he be godly and religious, they proue godly and religious; if he bee an Atheiſt, they prooue Atheiſts likewiſe. Therefore keep no companie with the wicked, for it is moſt, pernicious: but aſſociate thy ſelfe with thoſe that feare the Lord, that thou alſo maieſt learne to feare the Lord: who for his mercy grant that we may with Zaccheus be deſirous to ſee Chriſt, ioyfull to receiue Chriſt, liberall to releeue the members of Chriſt, and ready to make amends when we haue <note place="margin">Pſal. 18.</note> wronged any of our brethren, that ſo with Zaccheus wee may be heires of ſaluation, and the true ſons of Abraham to raigne with Chriſt in heauen for euer, by the meanes and merites of him that died and roſe againe for vs. To whom with the Father and the holy Ghoſt be all glorie,</p>

                        <hi>Simeon</hi> alſo waited for the conſolation of Iſrael, vntill hee had embraced in his armes him whom hee ſo long longed to ſee and feele. How many waiters bee there in the world? yet few wait as <hi>Simeon</hi> did: but ſome wait for honours, ſome for riches, ſome for pleaſures, ſome for eaſe, ſome for rewards, ſome for money, ſome for a deere yeere, and ſome for a golden day, as they call it: but <hi>Simeon</hi> waited and expected with many a long looke, vntill he had ſeene and embraced Chriſt Ieſus, the light of the Gentiles, the glory of Iſrael; the ſaluation of all that with a faithfull and zealous affection and loue doe waite for his comming, to the comſort of the afflicted, and to the terrifying of the wicked and vngodly, which haue not already waited, neither embraced him as <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> did.</p>

                        <hi>Simeon</hi> came into the Temple at this time by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. The worldlings will call it chance, but <note place="margin">Pro. 16. 13. Mat. 10. 39.</note> the Euangeliſt would not chop that in, becauſe it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that al things come to paſſe by the prouidence of God, without which there is nothing done. By this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence Rebecca came forth to wait on her fathers cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, <note place="margin">Gen. 24. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19.</note> when Abrahams ſeruant praied, and looked for her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, that he might take her for Iſaac to marry withal. By this prouidence Saul was annointed king by Samuel, <note place="margin">1. Sam 9. 20. &amp; 10. 1.</note> when he had no ſuch thought in his heart, but went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeeking for his fathers aſſes that were loſt.</p>
                     <q>And he came by the motion of the ſpirit.</q>
                     <p>The diuell led Chriſt vnto the top of an high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that hee might ſhew him the glory of the worlde, which deceiueth vnſtable minds: ſo would he doe you, if you would be led by ſuch a guide: but I would not haue you to marke the vaine motions of ſuch a ſpirite, which leades to nothing but to vanity and pride: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath led you to the top, and allured you by carnall pleaſures as much as hee can, if you then fall downe to worſhip Mammon, &amp; embrace the world, the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will afterward lead you, nay rather caſt you downe from the top of all vnto hell. Therefore I beſeech you, and heartily entreat you, that you would bee the ſeruants of God, and ſeruants of the ſpirit of God, to be led by it, to obey it, and to do nothing contrary to his will that you can refraine, but all thoſe good things which you would were done by you, and go thither whither you would come; for all would come to heauen, but all will not goe to heauen. If you will all heare, I will teach you all: yea, J wil vndertake this: heare and mark my words, and you ſhall be led by the power of the ſpirit to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And I pray to the Lord that I may neuer preach to the condemnation of any among you all; yea I wiſh that euery one of you were more zealous and more godly then my ſelfe.

If they would haue ſaid, In the name of Ieſus whom we preach, they might haue preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but they thought it ſufficient that Paul preached him, though they neuer profeſſed him. And ſo we leane vpon an others ſtaffe, and thinke to be ſaued, becauſe God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth others. We ſhall be dealt withal as were thoſe vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond Iewes: for he will anſwere: ſuch I know, and ſuch I know; but who are yee? Therefore it behooueth vs all to pray vnto the Lord, that hee would furniſh vs with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to encounter againſt all the euill motions of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sathan, that we may ouercome, and not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and put to flight, like thoſe vagabond Iewes, but that we may haue oyle alwaies in our lamps burning, and alwaies armed with watchfulneſſe againſt our enemies, leſt Sathan ſteale vpon vs vnawares, in the darke, and lead vs to fulfill his luſts, and ſpoile vs, and ſtrip vs, and leaue vs ſtarke naked.</p>

                     <p>Happy <hi>Simeon</hi> embracing Chriſt, but not happy that he embraced him with his hands, but therefore happie, becauſe he embraced him in heart. Happy are they and bleſſed which ſee the things that ye ſee, and the eares <note place="margin">Mat. 13 16.</note> that heare the things that ye heare, ſaith Chriſt; but cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are we, that hearing and ſeeing doe not repent: for we cannot be bleſſed by hearing and ſeeing only, vnleſſe we heare and ſee with profite, ſo that we in hart embrace Chriſt. But we will obiect, that we are Iſraelites, and are circumciſed, and haue receiued the Sacrament of Chriſts blood, that we might be his people, and he our God: but this will not excuſe vs, nor make vs ſeem any thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſight of God, but rather worſe, if we haue not ceaſed to embrace the world, to embrace vanities, and <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 20. 22. 23. 24.</note> haue vnfainedly embraced the word of God, and alſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For it is ſaid, that Chriſt came amongſt his owne, and his owne receiued him not: but therefore <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 11.</note> accurſed are ſo many of them as reiect their own ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which being freely offered vnto them, wil not ſtretch forth their hands to receiue it: that is, will not attend with their eares to hear it, or at leaſt wil not enlarge their hearts to embrace it.</p>
                     <q>And praiſed.</q>
                     <p>If Samuel had heard the firſt time that God called him, then God needed not to call him the ſecond or the third. Jf Peter had marked the crowing of the Cocke <note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> at the firſt time, as he did at the third, the Cocke needed not to crowe thrice.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, when you heare the ſame ſound againe which you haue heard before, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber now that the Cock croweth the ſecond time: for you know what diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity doth come by negligence, and what commodity by attention: for if you attend and follow, iuſtice ſhall bee ſwallowed vp of mercy.</p>
                     <q>
                        <pb facs="tcp:178039:25"/>Simeon praiſed God.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Simeon</hi> was thankfull. Here is the example, but where be they that follow it? If nine lepers be cleanſed, yet but <note place="margin">Luke 17.</note> one returneth to giue thanks, then one is all. Vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes is the firſt gueſt that ſitteth at the table; for ſome wil not ſticke to ſay, that they neuer ſaid grace ſince they were children: but if they had ſaid, they neuer had grace ſince they were children: but if they had ſaid, they neuer had grace ſince they were children, I would rather beleeue them. Doe you not ſay, <hi>Giue vs this day our dayly bread?</hi> If you do, for ſhame ſay ſo no more, beg no more at Gods ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, vntill you bee more thankfull for that you haue receiued. <note place="margin">Leu. 16. 16.</note> For behold, the heauens frown vpon you for your ſinnes, and the earth denieth her fruite, and is become barren, becauſe of your vnthankfulneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And praiſed God, and ſaid: &amp;c.</hi> Here <hi>Simeon</hi> praied and praiſed God, yet but in few words, for God delighteth not in much babling: hee praied not like the Ethnicks, the Phariſies, or the Prieſts of Baal; but <hi>Simeon</hi> praied with the heart like Moſes, and was heard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And ſaid.</hi> He ioyfully praiſing God ſpake, yea ſweetly as it were ſung it. Though you ſing all Dauids Pſalmes ouer, and haue not Dauids ſpirit, it profiteth nothing: and though Dauid was heard when he ſung them, yet you cannot be heard. Therefore let vs pray ſo, that our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may be heard. But we cannot with the heart, &amp; ſo that <note place="margin">Pro. 28. 9.</note> we may be heard pray, if we turne away our eares from the word: for ſo doing, whatſoeuer praiers we make, they are abominable. Therefore let vs heare ſo, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring we may profit by it. Let vs not heare ſtill ſo vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably as we were wont to doe: if we do, it ſhall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at our hands. Do you think you ſhall neuer be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to account of that which J haue preached vnto you, and therefore as ſoone as ye are gone out of this place, al is ſhut vp, and all is forgotten; God is exempted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your minds? Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, the word I ſpeake vnto you ſhal iudge you at the laſt day. Mary is commended <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 48. Luke 10. 41.</note>
                        <pb facs="tcp:178039:25"/> for that ſhe heard our Sauiour very diligently, laying vp his words in her hart, &amp; Iacob was wiſer then al his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in that he remembred the dreame of Ioſeph vntill he ſaw it fulfilled. Thoſe that loue the Lord with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained loue, do gladly heare his voice and become obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: &amp; they that loue <note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 17. 2. Sam. 6. 14. Gen. 21.</note> the Ark as Dauid did, will dance about the Arke as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid did, and that with ioy and gladnes. Iſaac was a good man, his name ſignified laughter, whereby was ſhewed what ioy and laughter there ſhould bee about Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, for he was the figure, the truth was Chriſt himſelfe. The Virgin ſung when ſhe knew that ſhee ſhould beare <note place="margin">Luke 2 46. Luk. 2. 13. 14.</note> him, the Angels ſung ioyfully when he was borne, and <hi>Simeon</hi> ſung when he was brought into the Temple.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Simeon</hi> had not longed, and ſo waited for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſhould hee now haue had this ioy and exultation? he could not haue felt it, for as our deſire is, ſo is our ioy. And ſurely therefore we receiue not ſound comfort, or feele ſmall ioy by the preaching of the Goſpell, becauſe we with longing wait not for it, we haue no liuely deſire of it, we hunger and thirſt not after it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy ſeruant depart. Simeon</hi> waiting for the conſolation of Iſrael, longing to ſee the Sauiour, was like the Hart panting for the water brooks, til he had beheld his beſt beloued: but as ſoone as hee had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in his armes, whom his ſoule deſired to ſee, hee ſo thirſted for death, that he thenceforth thought of, ſought after, beſought God for nothing, but to leaue this life, &amp; hence to depart: for he forthwith ſinging, praied: <hi>Now letteſt thou thy ſeruant depart.</hi> But doe you (ſay ſome) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him herein? did he well? May not any man deſire death? may not the faſtned ſhip in a ſtrange land deſire to be looſed to haſten to his longed for port at home? may not a man impriſoned amongſt bitter enemies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſet at liberty, to returne to his owne country, in freedome to liue amongſt his ſweet friends? Are wee not
<pb facs="tcp:178039:26"/> ſtrangers heere, and by vnpeaceable moſt deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, our owne fleſh, the world, and the diuell, held pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the chaines of ſinne, and manifold infirmities? and is not our home, heauen; and the Saints and Angels, our moſt deere friends? No maruell then that <hi>Simeon</hi> here deſireth to bee looſed, or let depart. And Paul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 23.</note> hee deſired to be diſſolued or vnlooſed, as ſhips in a ſtrange land faſtned, as ſtrangers amongſt cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies impriſoned. They were vnnaturall if they did not: it were vnreaſonable to require they ſhould not: for wee not onely may thinke it lawfull, but muſt alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, euen a neceſſary duty to deſire death. For is there till then in vs any perfect, yea any pure obedience of God? Doth not ſinne as long as this life laſteth, dwell in our members? Is there any paſſage to the perfect life, but by the firſt death? The fiſh which is taken in the net out of the ſea, ſtrugleth to get in againe: and Adam thruſt out of Paradiſe, would faine haue beene within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: how much more ſhould we be deſirous to bee ſetled in the true Paradiſe, in aſſurance neuer to bee put from thence? Therefore alſo it is not onely our dutie to deſire death, but alſo as ſoone as any cleerly ſeeth Chriſt, preſently hee deſireth to die. For though his ſtate bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo pleaſant, though his life bee moſt delightful, though hee excell in riches, and pleaſures, and honours, and knowledge, and glory, and ſarre exceede all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were: yet at the ſight of Chriſt hee euen reioyceth to forgoe all, the loue of the world falling away like the mantle of Elias when hee was rapt into heauen, and ſo crieth with the Apoſtle, <hi>I deſire to bee diſſolued;</hi> that he may be with Criſt. For Chriſt is light, and as ſoone as they ſee him, they ſee alſo themſelues and the worlds falſe happineſſe: his glory, and their ſhame and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which maketh them wiſh for death, that they may ceaſe to ſinne againſt God, &amp; perfectly pleaſe him and enioy true happineſſe with him: for all ſinne is blood in
<pb facs="tcp:178039:26"/> their eies, and all worldly pleaſures vanities.</p>

For not onely the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paul, but all theſe, and whoſoeuer are grounded in the faith of Chriſt, but eſpecially all that haue ſtrong hope to aduance the honour of God, are in a ſtraite, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Philip. 1. 23. and cruſht on both ſides, euen with two contrary deſires: to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all for themſelues; and to continue amongſt men, which is moſt needfull for them. So that this remaineth a manifeſt moſt neceſſary dutie, and of all that haue truelie, as <hi>Simeon,</hi> beleeued in Chriſt, performed: namely, thenceforth ſtill to deſire death, though they alſo withall deſired, life for others, death for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                     <p>Yet all that deſire death performe not a dutie: for the wicked often deſire to die, but not duely: for, though they wiſh ſometimes for it, and be willing alſo to abide it: yet do they not in heart deſire it, becauſe they thinke it not a thing in the ordinance of God good, and that for them, but vtterly hate it, holding it an extreame euill. For they acknowledge as, the trueth is, it will depriue them of all ther delights which heere they deſire, and they cannot but at leaſt feare, it will take from them all pleaſure, and bring them to eaſeleſſe, and yet endleſſe

                        <hi>ſaith my God.</hi> For in their ſtrong hope they feele a ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging feare, their greateſt confidence is not without trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of conſcience. Therefore fearing the euent of death to be for them (as indeed it is) moſt horrible, they vtterly abhorre it, they deteſt it extreamely. How then (ſay ſome) ſhould they ſeeke death ſo eagerly? How ſhould they murder themſelues ſo willingly? They doe it not altogether willingly, but wittingly; not freely, but forced with feare of ſome ſuppoſed greater euill: The troubles of this world, the anguiſh of body, the horrour of mind, they are moſt impatient of, they cannot, they will not endure them, and thereupon they ſometimes preferre death before life, leſſe willing to liue in vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then dying to try, whether they ſhall feele what they feare, euen deſerued damnation: for they are neuer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die, but vnwilling to liue often, and ſo work them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues endleſſe woe, in hope of ſuppoſed happineſſe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring life, not truly deſiring death. For how die they, when they moſt voluntarily bereaue themſelues of life? not in loue of God, longing to pleaſe him, performing all ſeruice to him: but either in paine of bodie, or elſe anguiſh of mind, either raging that they cannot ſatisfie their luſts, or haue loſt outward things immoderatelie loued: for fearing, if they die, deſerued torments: if they
<pb facs="tcp:178039:27"/> liue they ſhall either continue in felt horrour, or loſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for honour: either impatient of Gods rod, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt him that they ſo heauily feele his fury, and cannot fiercely fulfill their malitious minds, or freelie feede on the reſt of their fleſhly luſtes, or impotent in their deſire of ſome falſe fondly conceiued good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, with dreadfull doubting, by death to better their ſtate, they chooſe rather to prooue the truth of Gods threats, and of the terrors of their trembling minds, then in life to remaine any longer, rather abhorring life, then any way truly deſiring death. Therefore, in that <hi>Simeon</hi> duly deſired death, that which we heard of <hi>Simeon</hi> in the beginning is proued true, to wit, that he was <hi>iuſt and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For none but the truly religious, none but they that by faith are aſſured they are before God righteous, can rightly deſire death. For who would deſire a change but for the better? But all that are ignorant of God, all the vnfaithfull, what knowledge ſoeuer they haue, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in better caſe dead, then they are now in liuing, though moſt miſerably pained: nay, they cannot be without iuſt feare when they forgoe this life, to feele for euer the ſecond death. But the faithfull hauing their conſciences quiet, and alſo ioyfull in Chriſt, free from the feare of that death they haue deſerued, and aſſured by death to paſſe to that life which God to all faithfull hath promiſed, earneſtly wiſh to die in feruent loue of God, and zeale of his glory, that ſo they may ceaſe from offending their good God, and neuer ceaſe magnifying his mercy; ſhewing thereby that they are weary of the ſeruice and bondage of Sathan and ſinne, and aſſured af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death to enioy the true life, moſt fully glorifying God, and moſt perfectly pleaſing him for euer: and therefore alſo they deſire death, not ſhortning their life, but waiting his leiſure and calling, thereby glorifying God, as in their liues they haue done, and ſought to doe.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:178039:28"/>
                     <p>For man was not borne at his owne will, and therefore may not die at his owne pleaſure. Therfore they beg it of God, referring themſelues euer to his good will, when, where, and how by death they ſhall glorifie him, ſtil deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, but neuer wilfully procuring it.</p>
                     <p>If any obiect, that Sampſon pluckt the houſe on his owne head, as well as on the Philiſtines, we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that Sampſon was a figure of Chriſt; and therfore as it were offring himſelfe to God a ſacrifice, firſt praied, and then glorified God at his death, more then al his life, in killing ſo many of Gods enemies.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe they waite the Lords leaſure, they not only wilfully murder not themſelues, but are carefull alſo leſt fooliſhly vnwittingly they haſten it. For all they are guilty of their owne blood, that either by foole-hardie, raſh, or vnwiſe behauing, or with ſurfets, drunkenneſſe, or any intemperat vſing of themſelues, ſhorten their life. Yea, though they tender their liues neuer ſo deere, yet are they in the guilt, becauſe they willingly vſe the meanes that brings death.</p>

                        <hi>Simeon</hi> had ſeene much in his many daies, but when he ſaw Chriſt, he was vnwilling to liue any longer to ſee more.

But others heare it as though they heard it not, like deafe adders which ſtop their eares at the voyce of the charmer. So Pharao would not heare the voyce of Moſes, nor Baals Prieſts the voyce of Elias: and others <note place="margin">Exod. 5. &amp;c. 1.

                     <p>The ſeede is not caſt all on a heape, but it is caſt abroad: therfore where be the fruites of the ſpirit that you haue brought forth?

                     <p>If the Papiſts would haue men to depart in peace, they would neuer ſay, that thoſe which depart goe to Purgatory: for ſo by their owne ſaying, the worſt part is behind. For they affirme, that the paine thereof is farre grieuouſer then any that in this life may be ſuſtained. But againe, ſome ſay, this Purgatory is in the earth neere to hell, and ſo it is too farre from heauen to be ſaued. Some doe ſay, they are puniſhed there by fire; and ſome ſay, by water; and ſome ſay, by fire and water. Some laſtly doe ſay, that the good Angels torment; and others ſay that the euil ſpirits doe it. Jn this variety of moſt vncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table opinions, how is it poſſible hence to depart in peace? But wee muſt vnderſtand it is a painted Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, made for the pampering of the liuing, not for the puniſhing or purifying of them that be dead. For the locuſt of Rome doe liue altogether by ſuch Trentalles, and by ſuch traditions, and this is the profitableſt dream that euer any of them dreamed: but it is manifeſt by the <note place="margin">Prou. 30.

But let vs take heed how we make trifles of ſinnes, for there is no dallying with God, who is iealous as a conſuming <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 29.</note> fire, when his people make ſuch ſmall account of his words. Other demaund, whether it be not better to ſay. God be with them, than the diuell be with them; both which are naught and to be eſchewed.

                     <p>Some will ſay, it is a teſtimony of our good will. To ſuch we muſt reply, ſaying; ſo it is a teſtimony of your ignorance: and then after a little conference they will graunt, that indeed it doth not profit them. Then wee muſt reply and ſay, God hath made all things to profite vs, and hath commanded that nothing bee vſed vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably no not ſo much as a vaine word ſpeaking, ſaying; <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 36.</note> that for euery idle word wee muſt giue account at the day of iudgement.

For indeed it muſt proceede of harme being ſpoken in doubting without faith; for if you beleeued that they were laid vp in peace, whom you pray for, what neede you pray for them at all? But it ſhewes an vnbeleeuing hart, and we know that whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne, and the Lord will ſay of them, who hath required theſe things at your hands? <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 23.</note> You haue wrought vanities. Now therefore you will not leaue it becauſe you vſed it: then wil you ſay alſo, we will not leaue our lying, nor our ſwearing, nor our curſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue vſed it.

                     <p>When Sathan hath thus poſſeſſed vs with this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that in the ſeruice of God we may neglect the word of God, then profites and pleaſures guide vs in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: but they that doe ſo profeſſe Religion and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, can neuer haue any comfort by it all their life. For their owne hearts accuſe them for hypocrites, becauſe they wait not for the conſolation of God, according to his word, and whatſoeuer is not done according to that word, cannot be acceptable: and this word they care not for, neither haue it in eſtimation. When Adam ſeeth his nakednes, the ſubtile ſerpent can deceiue no longer, but before he ſeeth his nakedneſſe, he is euer deceiued, and led away with the multitude into innumerable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.

And yet ſee their blindnes, for they ſeeme to thinke that their torment ſhall not ceaſe as long as the world ſtandeth; elſe why ſhould they find and hire men to ſay Maſſe for them ſo long? but theſe are the far mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Baals Prieſts, and for this cauſe is the Popiſh Creed made very fauourable to the Cleargy-Wel, ſay that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the mother of their deuotion, for when the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touines of the Prieſts and the Ignorance of the people ioyned together, then they inuented Purgatory, Maſſes, Prayer for the dead, and then all their trinkets. For if they had not held our Fathers in ignorance, keeping them from the word, they would neuer haue beene Papiſts.

Luke 5.</note> ſee that the words of the Scripture are true, which ſaith, that Chriſt was perfect man in all things, ſinne onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. For he ſometime wept, as at the death of Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, and like wiſe ouer Ieruſalem. Sometime he thirſted, as at the Well where the woman of Samaria diſputed with him: and alſo ſometime eate, as at Marthaes houſe, as alſo among Publicans and ſinners, and in euery thing ſhewed himſelfe to be perfect man.</p>

                     <p>O Lord, ſaith he, I deſire now to be diſſolued and free from the bondage of ſin, which ſo long hath inhabited in my mortall body, for now he is come, by whom thou haſt promiſed to free and ſet vs at liberty, he is come by whom thou haſt promiſed to breake the Serpents head, and he is come that will heale our infirmities, and giue ſtrength againſt ſin and ſathan by faith &amp; peace towards God through loue. And now, ſaith hee, I haue embraced him, and thankfully do receiue him. I beleeue, &amp; am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that this is the ſame Meſſias, whom the Father promiſed, and the Prophets fore-told, all Iſrael longed &amp; expected for, who is the light of the Gentiles, the glory of Iſrael, and the God of the whole world. So they which loue the truth of God, and waite with deſire to bee
<pb facs="tcp:178039:32"/> filled with the knowledge thereof, ſuch ſhall not die vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they haue their harts deſire with contemplation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <note place="margin">Acts 10. Acts 8.</note> For as Peter was ſent to Cornelius, and Philip to the Eunuch: ſo the Lord will ſtirre vp ſuch of his ſeruants, as may bee fit inſtruments to miniſter the ſame vnto vs. Iudas indeed died before the time, and liued not to ſee Chriſt crucified, but the Diſciples which loued Ieſus, did ſee him die like an vndefiled innocent Lambe, and that to their exceeding ioy and comfort, when they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood how that he ſuffered death for loue of them and for their redemption. Now if Chriſt cannot hide him from ſuch as hunger after him through loue, then what ſhall we ſay of our Fathers which liued in the time of ignorance, that longed to ſee his light, although they had a miſt caſt before their eyes? Surely, ſuch died not till they ſaw Chriſt, and embraced him in their hearts. And this is our iudgement concerning them that died in the time of Popery. And likewiſe as concerning the reſt, which thought to be ſaued by Purgatory and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes after that they are dead, we ſay that they which ſleep without oyle in their lampes they die ere they are aware of, and ere they wiſh for it, like the Philiſtines which ſent for Sampſon to laugh and mocke at him, and to ſport <note place="margin">Iudg. 16.</note> themſelues, vpon whom the houſe fell and deſtroyed them all: or the Egyptians, which thought that the waters had made paſſage for them aſwell as for the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eliers, <note place="margin">Ezod. 16.</note> both which died in and for their ſecurity becauſe they were not watchfull, nor prepared againſt the Lord called them.</p>

                     <p>Beloued, you are not ignorant that the great day of the Lord is neer at hand, and therfore they that haue not yet ſeene Chriſt, they that haue not yet embraced him, but ſtill ſleepe without oyle in their lampes, ſhal ſodainly be ouertaken without the wedding garment, and ſhall be caſt into eternall torment for euer.</p>

                     <p>There be many ſights of Chriſt, all goe not vp to the mount, as Peter, Iames and Iohn, all ſee not his face with <note place="margin">Matth. 17. Exod. 33. Iohn 13. 2.

                     <p>To ſome he ſhewes himſelfe as in a glaſſe, to ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, <note place="margin">Mat. 20.</note> to ſome particularly, ſome he calleth early, and ſome hee calleth late, and there is no houre in the day, wherein he calleth not ſome to get labour in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. To ſome he ſheweth himſelfe by Angels, &amp; to otherſome by viſions. Abraham ſaw three Angels, Lot <note place="margin">Gen. 18. Gen. 19.

It is ſaide that Abraham ſaw Chriſt his daies; but we ſee him cleerer then Abraham, and cleerer then Iohn, if we beleeue in him as we ſhould. Some ſee <note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> Chriſt, and not his ſaluation, and ſome ſee his ſaluation,
<pb facs="tcp:178039:33"/> and doe not embrace it. We ſee Chriſt when wee heare his word, and we embrace his ſaluation when we beleeue it: they ſee him that heare him, they embrace him that follow him. Heere if they had heard me, I would haue ſearched Ieruſalem with lampes, to ſee who ſitteth in darkenes. But how can they beleeue the word of God which heare it not? how can they embrace Chriſt which know him not? and all through ignorance, hauing not the meanes to ſee him, becauſe their leaders are either blind guides, ſleepy watchmen, or hireling ſheepheards. And ſurelie it is a wofull caſe, when ſhepheards goe to taske, and let their owne ſheepe alone ſummer &amp; winter. They ſheare them, but neither ſummer nor winter doe they feede them. How ſhould thoſe people vnder their charge ſee Chriſt and his ſaluation, when they are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred of the wholeſome food, and euen ſtarued to death many thouſands of their ſoules, becauſe they haue not the foode that nouriſheth the ſoule vnto ſaluation? and how many bee there that are as old as <hi>Simeon,</hi> and yet haue not embraced Chriſt Ieſus? yea they know him not though they ſee him, neither do they wait for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, becauſe they haue no deſire to embrace him, and therefore they defer that &amp; put it off from their youth to their middle age, from their middle age to their old age, from their old age to death, and ſo they can haue no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in all their life to embrace him. But to ſuch as doe ſeek him, &amp; wait for him with vnfained diligence, we ſay as the Angel ſaid vnto the woman at the ſepulchre, feare <note place="margin">Iohn 20.</note> not, you ſeeke the Lord Ieſus. How is this world ſet to deceiue vs? We can find leaſure to doe euill at any time, but we can find no leaſure in all our life long to doe good, that we may at length enioy the true ſaluation.</p>
                     <p>I haue ſomwhat to ſay to you of this pariſh: A dainty was prepared for you, and you let the ſtrangers take it from you; you were required to a faſt, and you did feaſt your ſelues; you were required to come &amp; pray vnto the

                     <q>Thy ſaluation.</q>
                     <p>He came not by Angels, or by men, or by any other meanes, but onely from the alone and eternall God.

Then is not this Iehouah the mighty God, whoſe birth is glorious, whoſe life is famous, which death is merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? None can take vpon him the authoritie of God, but he, on whoſe ſhoulders the Lord layeth it, beeing ſent of God, and from God. Then we ſee that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is the true Sauiour ſent from God, for all creatures beare witneſſe vnto him, yea the very diuels, with all the euils ſpirits doe obey his voyce at whoſe name all knees <note place="margin">Mark 1.

He came not to bring health, wealth, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or profits, for the which if he had, then multitudes of worldlings would haue followed him; but hee came to bring ſaluation, righteouſnes, peace, truth, and life, <note place="margin">Matt. 7.</note> therefore few care for him. Hee came to ſaue ſinners, not all ſinners, not euery one that ſayeth Lord, Lord, <note place="margin">Luke 5.</note> but he came to ſaue penitent ſinners, which turne vnto God by their repentance. Therefore he praieth in Iohn <note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> for thoſe onely that were giuen vnto him. So ſoone as the ſeede is ſowne, the ſtones refuſe it, or the Sunne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it, or the thornes choake it, and what comfort

                     <p>Chriſt is their ſaluation that beleeue in him, and make much of him, and thankfully receiue him. The godly he deliuereth from ſinne, but the wicked he leaueth bound in the chaines of their iniquity, to be tormented of him which had tempted them thereunto, whoſe will they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies endeuoured to fulfill, and not the Lords; and hee ſheweth them a hand vpon the wall writing writing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and another catching them by the hairy ſcalp <note place="margin">Dan. 5.</note> which maketh all their ioynts to tremble, and their harts to deſpair, and he ſaith vnto them; What doſt thou heere without thy wedding garment?

                     <q>Thy ſaluation.</q>
                     <p>The onely Sauiour is heere called ſaluation it ſelfe: for if he were called a bare Sauiour only, then you might likely vnderſtand by ſome other Sauiour; but heere is
<pb facs="tcp:178039:34"/> he is called ſaluation it ſelfe, to ſhew that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For there be more Sauiours, but no more ſaluations, as there be many waies to death, and yet but one death. The braſen Serpent was a figure of Chriſt, that they which are ſtung by ſin, by fire, and by the Serpent which <note place="margin">Numb. 22.

                     <p>The Papiſts haue found out many ſaluations, they haue found out a ſaluation by Saints, a ſaluation by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, a ſaluation by maſſes, a ſaluation by merits, a ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Idols, as though Chriſt had leaſt to doe in his own office, for they haue other ſaluations to flee vnto: They will haue it, but they will buy it, and what will they giue for it? Why, they will faſt ſo many daies, goe ſo far on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, hire Prieſts to ſay ſo many Maſſes, build ſo many Abbies, and giue ſo many ſummes of Money to the Monks and Friers. Therefore the Scripture goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and diſhonours their ſhameleſneſſe, who (like Nimrod, that heaping ſtone vpon ſtone, would haue built vp to heauen) heape ſinne vpon ſinne, and euerie <note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> houre, ſome one hereſie or ſuperſtition groweth vp from this filthy roote.</p>
                     <p>For what Papiſt dare ſay, that <hi>Simeon</hi> thought on any of theſe, or put confidence in any other Sauiour, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Gal 3. 1. 18. 2 Cor. 1. Gen. 42.</note> in him whom he embraced in his armes? For ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is by the promiſe of God, and all promiſes are in Chriſt. And though Iacob wanted bread, Ioſeph wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not mony, therefore he gaue them backe again their money, and likewiſe he gaue them that corne that they would haue bought with it. I would wiſh them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay as Ioſephs brethren did, that they haue their corne for nothing, and their mony too: let them I ſay be content and reioyce, to ſay, that they haue mercy for nothing, and their works too.

As it is proper vnto God to be called goodneſſe, ſo is it proper vnto Ieſus Chriſt to be called ſaluation. He is alſo called the way, the truth, and the life: for that life <note place="margin">Iohn 14.</note> which wee haue, is but a ſparke and ſhadow of life, but he is the true and eternall life.</p>
                     <p>Then ſeeing Chriſt is both our righteouſneſſe, ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and alſo the way, the trueth, and the life, to leade vs thereunto: it is as poſſible for vs without Chriſt to be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified or glorified, as it is to be wiſe without wiſedome, righteous without righteouſnes, or ſaued without ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore let vs not be aſhamed to take our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the fountaine, ſeeing Chriſt is the fountaine of all wiſedome, of all righteouſneſſe, of all truth, of all knowledge, of all ſaluation, and briefly of all goodneſſe: for there is no other Arke to ſaue vs from the floud, no other ladder to aſcend with into heauen, no other Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph to feede vs in the famine, no other Moſes to lead vs through the wildernes.</p>
                     <p>But as the riuer Siloa runneth through all the land of Iudea, and watereth the whole Citie of God: ſo Chriſt <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 2. Cor. 15.

                     <p>Saluation is borne, therefore we were all in the ſtate of condemnation before: light is come, therefore we ſate all in darkens before: glory is come, therefore we were all loaden with ſhame before: life is come, to ſhew that we were all dead in ſinne before. Life is come, and light and ſaluation: life to the dead, light to the blind, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to the damned. For Chriſt is called ſaluation, to ſhew that without him, we are all damned fire-brands of hel, heires of condemnation, and forſaken of God. To him that is ſicke, it is eaſie to bee thankfull when hee is whole, but when he is whole, it is harder to be thankfull then to be ſicke.

Hee giues the ſonne for the baſtard, the Lord for the ſeruant, the righteous for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the innocent for the wicked, and the Almightie Lord, for the ſinfull ſonnes of men. Doe you not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel how you can offend this Lord willingly, which hath done ſo much for you? Heere I reprooue vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſecuritie and negligence, ſtriuing as it were to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Chriſt againe, as the wicked Jewes did, who neuer proſpered ſince the time that they ſaid; His blood bee vpon vs, and vppon our ſeede. They were not like <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi> who as foone as he ſaw him, embraced him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced ouer him. There is no ſhew of grace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>which <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 25.</note> ſhew no liking of godlines, neither in themſelues nor in others: for this is the firſt part of our conuerſion, to loue them that loue God, and ſo they are drawne to the Sonne.

                     <p>Wee preach vnto you, and call vpon you, wee haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen wearied our ſelues among you, wee haue reprooued you for ſinne, and wee muſt ſtill reprooue you vntill you amend: now therefore, if there bee any grace in you, if ye haue any knowledge, any feare of God in you, if you haue any goodnes in you, if you haue any leaſure to bee ſaued, turne backe now from doeing euill, come out of
<pb facs="tcp:178039:37"/> hell, and plucke your limbes out of the clouches of the Serpent, for verilie we haue not done ſo well in this city as the Niniuites did, for all the preaching and teaching we haue had. For, who hath determined in his heart to amend his life? Who hath left his pride? Who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored that which he hath taken by extortion, vſury, and wrong? Surely they that haue done thus are monſters, I cannot ſee him, he walkes inuiſible and cannot be found. The heauens trembled at the death of Chriſt, the Sunne did hide his face, the earth quaked, the vaile of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Matt. 27. 45. 51. 52. 53.</note> rent in ſunder, the dead bodies roſe out of their graues, and all this was to ſhew that the Prince of the world ſuffered violence, and that the Lord of life ſuffered death for the ranſome of vs, &amp; of all whoſoeuer through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world doe beleeue the goſpell, and liue in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereof, and withall, that hee ſuffering for ſinfull and wretched man, was a conqueror ouer hell and all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and hath ouercome death. The Scribes were againſt him, the Phariſes were againſt him, the Rulers band the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt him, the Atheiſts againſt him, and all the ſpitefull and enuious Iewes againſt him, whoſe birth was baſe, whoſe life was contemptible, and whoſe death was ignominious, but God was with him, &amp; in him, by whoſe power he ouercame them all, and ſo became the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God.</p>
                     <p>Dauid being to encounter with Goliah, Saul tooke <note place="margin">1.

And euen thus the Lord ſet his ſonne to fight with the Prince of this world, not with ſwords and targets, bowes and bills, but with the word and ſpirit of God, with the which he hath ouercome, and through him we alſo haue the victory.</p>

                     <p>He ſpeakes this to the end that the eies of all mankind may be fixed vpon him, as the eies of all Iſrael were fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Num. 22.</note> vpon the braſen Serpent in the wilderneſſe, that when they be ſtinged with the ſting of that fierie ſerpent which deceiued our forefathers, they may flie vnto him for help, loſt they periſh in their ſinne, &amp; their blood bee on their owne heads.</p>
                     <q>Which thou hast prepared.</q>
                     <p>He was prepared long agoe, as it doth moſt plainely appeare, for the virgin which bare him, the place of his birth, the poore eſtate wherein he was, his miracles, his Apoſtles, his torments, his croſſe, his death, his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and aſcenſion into heauen; all theſe were foreſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed and fore-told long before they came to paſſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome ſaid, Who is this that is ſo often ſpoken of by <note place="margin">Iohn 11. Luke 8. Matth. 27. Iohn 10. Marke 6.</note> the Prophets? Who is this that can doe many miracles that the Scribes and Phariſes cannot doe? that can raiſe the dead, that can ceaſe the windes, that can calme the waters: at whoſe ſuffering the earth quaked, the Sunne hid his face, darknes came ouer all: and beeing dead, roſe againe by his owne power, and aſcended into heauen in the ſight of a great multitude? How can it be then but it muſt be knowne <hi>before the face of all people,</hi> which was ſo manifeſt by dreames, by viſions, by oracles, by power; by authority, and euery thing? For there was nothing which had not a tongue to ſpeake for God. Euery thing was prepared for him before hee came to bee reuealed: hee came not in the beginning, nor in the ending: hee came not in the ending, that wee which come after him might long for his ſecond comming. He came not in the beginning, becauſe that ſuch a Prince as hee ſhould haue many banners and triumphs before him. Hee came not in the beginning, becauſe the eies of faith ſhould not bee dazeled in him, and leſt they which ſhould liue in the latter times, ſhould forget him and his comming
<pb facs="tcp:178039:38"/> which was ſo long before, euen as you forget that which I haue ſaid as ſoone as you are gone hence. Hee came not in the beginning, becauſe if he had come before man had ſinned, man would haue acknowledged no neede of a Phyſitian; but when man had ſinned and had felt the ſmart of ſinne: for when they were caſt out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe they ranne vnto Chriſt, as the Iſraelites did to the Serpent. He came not in the beginning, but in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect age of the world, to ſhew that he brought with him perfection, perfect ioy, perfect peace, perfect wiſedome, perfect righteouſnes, perfect iuſtice, perfect truth, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thereby, that not withſtanding he came in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect age thereof, yet he found all things vnperfect. The Iewes thought that he ſhould come like ſome great Prince, with pompe and glory, which was a carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, for heerein they were meruailouſly deceiued, his father was but a poore Carpenter, and his mother but a ſimple woman, and he a ſilly babe wrapt in clouts. Then ought not we to reuerence our Lord, and to praiſe his Name, for that he became ſo humble for vs moſt vile wretches that are worthy of nothing? yet we ſee how cruelly they dealt with this bleſſed One, which came to ſaue them. Ignorance ſate in the chaire, deceit gaue the ſentence, and cruelty executed him with the moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſhamefull death of the croſſe. O that your eies doe not dazell, and your eares tingle, and your hearts meruaile at this dealing of theirs to our louing Sauiour, which came to ſaue them that would, and ſpecially in that now you ſee, that he abaſed himſelfe for our ſakes. euen to the vttermoſt! O wonderfull thing to thinke of? Jf you would marke, J would make you in loue with him before I haue done with you, I ſay vnto all thoſe that come hither to be edified, take your fill of pleaſure, enter into Paradiſe, lift vp your eyes, ſtretch forth your hands, and eate your fill of the tree of life, and the Lord will goe home with you, embrace him and kiſſe him
<pb facs="tcp:178039:39"/> entertaine him well, and he will dwell with you for euer. But you that come hither for faſhion ſake, either to ſee or to bee ſeene, to finde fault with ſome-what, or to make an hypocriticall ſhew of godlineſſe where there is none: I tell you, that comfort ſhall ſhake hands with you at the dore: marke it, and you ſhall ſee that my words are true. Shew me what it is that is better then ſaluation. I would haue none of you to bee damned if I might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it, not ſo much as a peece of you to be giuen vnto ſathan, therefore I would J knew that ſtone that would kill Goliah, for I would ſtrike it with my might into his temples. If you will, you may be ſaued, and the Lord will one day put thoſe words into my mouth that will touch your hearts. Therefore now ariſe, kiſſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſweet babe Ieſus, and then afterward frame your ſelues to obey him, for then the Lord wil knocke at your hearts, and if you wil let him in, he will teach you all things. The Lord came not in the beginning, nor in the ending, but he came in the middle age of the world, to ſhew, that if it will not learne now, it will neuer learne <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> to come vnto God by repentance and amendment, that they may learne to kiſſe the ſonne leſt hee be angry, and ſo they periſh in his wrath like Sodome. Hee came in the middle age of the world to ſhew that he was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for the world to giue light and life vnto all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne <note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> vnto him. For God reſpecteth no perſons, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man of what nation or Countrey ſoeuer he be that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſſe, is accepted of him, and he will fufill their ioyes through Chriſt, yet not when wee will, but according to his owne good pleaſure and when he thinketh good. Therefore ſtay Helias, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non <note place="margin">1. King. 17. Exo. 14.</note> the Rauens wil bring thee meat, and thou ſhalt haue enough. Anon Moſes will deliuer Iſrael. So ſaluation is already prepared of God, and hath beene long ſince with fulneſſe of knowledge, and al excellent gifts, and he will giue them to vs when hee ſeeth good. But wee are
<pb facs="tcp:178039:39"/> like whining children, that will not ſtay vntill their milke bee cold, but would haue it though they be ſcalded with it: ſo wee would haue the knowledge of God and liberty before wee know how to vſe it. Wee would know the high myſteries and deepe counſels of God, before wee know our ſelues; we would haue the liberty of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when we know no way how to vſe it but in ſecurity. But the Lord, hee will wiſely giue vnto vs as it were our bellies full when he ſeeth it good, and when hee ſeeth vs ready for it, who knoweth our hearts better then we our ſelues.</p>
                     <q>A light to be reuealed to the Gentiles: and the glory of thy people Iſrael.</q>
                     <p>You haue heard <hi>Simeon</hi> ſhewing the cauſe why the ſonne was ſent from the Father, why hee became man, which raigned before in Paradiſe. VVhat mooued God to leaue his ioy and his bliſſe, and ſuffer more then all the world could ſuffer together? A great cauſe it is that would make a king leaue his kingdome and fal to begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. A great and wonderfull cauſe it was, that made Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah to come downe from heauen to ſuffer miſery vpon the earth. Two other cauſes <hi>Simeon</hi> ſheweth why this Meſſias came from heauen. The firſt, that he might enlighten the Gentiles, which ſate in darkneſſe: and the ſecond, that he might be the glory of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which gloried in their ſacrifices, and in their ceremonies, and ſo had no glorie before he came, but were like the Moone when the Sunne doth ſhine vpon it, or like Rachel which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed <note place="margin">Gen. 29.</note> Leah, and became barten. And they deſpiſed the Gentiles light; like that ſonne which was angry becauſe <note place="margin">Luk. 15.</note> his loſt brother came home againe; or like thoſe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers which checked the Lord of the vineyard, becauſe <note place="margin">Matth. 20.</note> he gaue vnto the other labourers as much as hee gaue vnto them. But the Gentiles are like Leah, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Gene. 29.</note> deſpiſed became fruitfull. <hi>Simeon</hi> did reioyce in Chriſt, not onely for that hee was the glory of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:178039:40"/> but alſo for that he was the light of the Gentiles. Shall the head be ſorrowfull becauſe the hand is well? Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the hand ſhould bee glad, becauſe the head is well, and the head becauſe the hand is well. The father ſhould be glad becauſe his ſonne is ſtronger then himſelfe, the mother ſhould be gladde becauſe her daughter is wiſer then her ſelfe, the brother ſhould bee glad, becauſe his brother is richer then himſelfe: the miſtreſſe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, becauſe her maid is a better huſwife then her ſelfe. But we enuie our brethren and our neighbours, becauſe they are better then we, and becauſe God hath bleſſed them with temporall or ſpirituall things aboue vs: if we ſee that they haue learning, then we enuie them for their learning; if he haue more gifts, wee enuy him for his gifts, if he haue more knowledge, wee enuy him for his knowledge, if he haue more zeale, we enuy them for his zeale, if he haue more riches, we enuy him for his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and how can we reioice when euery bodyes good is our euill and euery bodies ioy is our ſorrow? But fixe your eies vpon Chriſt alone, and he will fulfill your ioy, if you looke not backe to Sodome like Lots wife: if you loue ioy and gladnes; Chriſt is ioy and gladneſſe: if you <note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> loue comfort, why, Chriſt is the comforter of all that beare his croſſe: if you loue life, Chriſt is eternall life: if you loue peace, Chriſt is peace: if you loue riches, Chriſt is full of heauenly riches, and full of liberality, to beſtow them vpon all ſuch as loue God: ſo Chriſt is all in all vnto the godly, and they haue more ioy in Chriſt alwayes and in all things then the richeſt, and moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſumptuous prince in the world; then <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe had in worldly riches, honours, pleaſures, ioy, eaſe or felicity. For the wicked which put their truſt in riches, and make them gods of gold and money, of eaſe and pleaſures, though they do all that they can to fulfill their luſts, and take neuer ſo much pleaſure, and be neuer ſo merry, yet they can haue no true ioy, nor peace of
<pb facs="tcp:178039:40"/> conſcience; for all the peace, the mirth, and ſport they haue is but deceit, all falſe and indureable like the graſſe, <note place="margin">Eſa. 58. &amp;. 57.</note> greene in the morning, and withered ere night. But when the Lord doth knocke at their hearts &amp; ſtrike them with a feeling of their horrible tranſgreſſions, as no doubt hee will, then they are all in a maze, and they can haue no ioy, no peace, no reſt; but they may ſay, in laughter my ſoule is ſorrowfull, in eaſe my ſoule hath trouble, in mirth mone, in riches pouerty, in glory ſhame, in life my ſoule is euen dead, in plenty my ſoule wanteth all things wherein it ſhould reioyce, it is deſtitute of all comfort, <note place="margin">Gene. 4.</note> and poſſeſſed with all ſlauiſh feares; like Caine, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord of all the earth, yet had no ioy in it when God had once forſaken him. Likewiſe Saul when God had forſaken him, he had no ioy of his kingdome, nor of all his riches, and then who had more ioy, Saul the King, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 16.</note> or Dauid the ſubiects? So then we ſee that perfect ioy can be had in nothing but in God, and in Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore as by the ſtreame you may be led to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, euen ſo let the ioy and peace of this life ſerue to leade vs to God, which is perfect ioy and peace, and there reſt like the wiſe men which were guided by the ſtarre, to come to the true ſonne of grace, Ieſus Chriſt, when he was borne: and if we reſt not in him when wee haue found him, there is no reſt for vs, wee ſhall bee like the reſtleſſe Doue, which fluttered about, and found no reſt any way, till ſhe returned to the Arke: but wee ſeeme as though we ſought him and found him, when as we doe but play the hypocrites. Salomon ſaith that the waies of the whore are proſperity and welfare, for ſhe euer putteth on a vizard, that ſhe might not be knowne to bee ſo vile as ſhe is: ſo vnder the colour of goodnes euill is alwaies lurking.</p>
                     <p>Therefore alſo is Chriſt called the light, becauſe wee ſhould leaue our fooliſhneſſe, ſeeing light is come, and that wee ſhould forſake all our lights which are but
<pb facs="tcp:178039:41"/> darkneſſe, and cleaue vnto his light, which is the true light indeede.</p>
                     <q>A light to be reuealed to the Gentles, &amp;c.</q>
                     <p>He came to lighten the Gentiles, and they receiued him with thankfulneſſe, of whom there was no hope of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe left. Who would ſuppoſe that the barren woman ſhould become fruitfull, or the prodigall ſonne returne home againe? It is like as if one Owle ſhould be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee light, or as if the ſtreame would returne into the fountaine, or as if an old man ſhould become young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                     <q>A light to be reuealed to the Gentiles.</q>
                     <p>To be reuealed, not yet reuealed, the Iewes muſt firſt reiect him before the Gentiles receiue him: and when the Iewes did oppreſſe him, condemne him, and crucifie him, then were his armes ſpread vnto the whole world. When the gueſts would not come, then hee ſendeth into <note place="margin">Luke 14. 23.</note> the high waies, to compell others that would not come willingly vnto it. Comfort is on foote, and that which will come, ſhall come, &amp;c. The Queene of Saba came from the vttermoſt part of the earth to heare <hi>Salomons</hi> wiſedome, and the wiſemen came from the Eaſt to ſee Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> Chriſt: but we may ſay, the Lord was heere in the Temple, and I was in my ſhoppe, ſelling and buying, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deceiuing, and ſwearing. Well, when hee comes backe againe, I will be better acquainted with him; and ſo we eſteeme not of his preſence in any reuerent ſort. The Shunamite ſaid: Let vs build a chamber for the man of God: then we ſhould build an houſe. Zaccheus <note place="margin">2. Reg. 4. 20.

<pb facs="tcp:178039:41"/> and endeuour to ſee Chriſt bodily, he ſhewed himſelfe vnto him ſpiritually, euen to his hearts deſire.</p>
                     <q>To be reuealed.</q>

As for example, Salomon was wiſe, but he is fooliſh; Sampſon was ſtrong, but hee is weake; Iudas was a Preacher, but he is a traitour; Paul was a perſecutor, but he is a Preacher; Peter was a denier of Chriſt, but now he is a bold profeſſour of Chriſt; Moiſes was learned in the wiſedome of the Egyptians, but now he is learned in the wiſedome of God, by which the wiſedome of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians is made but meere fooliſhneſſe in the ſight of God. Others, as heathen philoſophers, Plato, Ariſtotle, Cato, Crates, and ſuch like, were counted very wiſe men in the ſight of the world, yea they wrote ſo many books full of wiſedome, and alſo adorned with notable ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and witty ſayings, that one would thinke all wiſdom were buried with them, ſo famous were they, and ſo full of earthly vnderſtanding, teaching maners, counſels and policies: yet for my part I haue neither ſeene nor heard of any ſuch, being wiſe in worldly things, and without the wiſedome of God, but that they haue committed ſome notorious fooliſhneſſe in the ſight of all men, like Achitophel, of whom we read, that he was ſo wiſe a counſeller, that his counſell was like as one had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">2. Sam. 16. 23 2. Sam. 17. 23.</note> counſell at the Oracle of God; and yet ſee the end of him, he hanged himſelfe, and all for the want of the knowledge of God. It had bin better therefore for him to haue had more wiſedome and leſſe wit. Crates, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle, Plato, and others of the wiſe Philoſophers, haue either poiſoned, burned, or drowned themſelues: and ſo wee ſee that the end of the worldlie wiſedom is meere <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 20.</note> fooliſhneſſe, and the fooliſh haue more peace then the wiſe: for their wiſedome without the feare of God, doth them no more good then the Arke did to the Philiſtines, which did nothing but torment them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">2.

                        <pb facs="tcp:178039:42"/> they knew not how to vſe it, and therefore vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently abuſed it. For if your wiſedome conſiſt in elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of words, in profunditie of wit, to gaine craftilie, and ſpend warily, to inuent lawes, to expound riddles, and interpret dreames, to tell fortunes, and prophecie of matters by learning: all your wiſedome is but vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit; for all theſe without the feare of God, doe vs no more good then their witte did theſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, which notwithſtanding ſate in darknes. And I am afraid though Chriſt broght light vnto the Gentiles, yet it may be ſaid, that the Gentiles ſit in darkneſſe ſtill, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a few Leuites ſcattered vpon the mountaines, for whoſe ſake Sodome is ſpared. And becauſe thoſe had not the knowledge of God, therefore they worſhipped Mars and Cupid, Sunne and Moone, beaſts and ſerpents: <note place="margin">2. King. 17. 30. Iud. 16. 23.

As for example, that the word ſhould be made of nothing, that the Word became fleſh that God and man was ioyned together in one perſon, that one man may be righteous in the righteouſneſſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; which is Chriſt, and that the dead ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: theſe ſeemed fooliſhnes vnto the Gentiles, neither could they beleeue them. No more can ſome Gentiles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs at this day, which are but naturall men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not beleeue them, for when they profeſſed themſelues to be wiſe, they became fooles, ſaith the holy Ghoſt. So then we ſee now what Chriſt hath done for vs, <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 22.</note> he hath bound that Serpent, which hath ſowne all the tares, ſo that the diuell is faine for want of better lodging to enter into ſwine.</p>
                     <p>Heeretofore, whereas one followed God, a thouſand followed Baal; But now Kings and Princes lift vp their
<pb facs="tcp:178039:42"/> heads, deſiring Chriſt to raigne with them and in them. Heeretofore we made our ſelues like the wounded man, we were ſpoiled, we were ſtript naked, and wee were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in our blood, being full of wounds; but now Chriſt hath furniſhed vs, he hath waſhed vs, hee hath cloathed vs, and wee are now become true Iſraelites: vs, which were the vile and wilde Oliues, hee hath grafted vpon the true Oliue, and planted vs in a fruitfull ſoile. And what cauſe can we ſhew for this, but onely mercie? For <note place="margin">Deut. 31.</note> heeretofore wee were called fooliſh, but the Lord hath made vs wiſe according to the wiſdome of God in theſe dayes by his Spirit: but if yee deſerue to bee called the fooliſh Nation againe, then yee are moſt vnhappy and moſt curſed. So now we haue heard, that the Lord doth reueale his counſell vnto his Prophets, and how the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Iſrael is now reuealed to bee the light of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. And you haue the cauſe why: becauſe the Iewes reiected their owne ſaluation. You haue heard that the cauſe was onely his mercy and his loue, becauſe mercy cannot containe it ſelfe within <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>A light to be reuealed to the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Iſrael.</q>
                     <p>You haue heard why Chriſt is called light, why hee is called the light of the Gentiles, why the Lord did change a curſe into bleſſing, and why the Gentiles did change darkenes for light, and a thouſand gods for one true God. Then the Gentiles receiued more grace then they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for the Lord came vncalled vnto their houſes, and made a feaſt vnto them in their owne houſes. The light of the Gentiles is our light, your light and my light: Chriſt is our grace, your grace, &amp; my grace: and Chriſt is our ſaluation, your ſaluation, and my ſaluation. Hee came vnto the Iewes, &amp; for the Iewes, and yet his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto the Gentiles, was better then to the Iewes. Hee came into the world when the world did abound
<pb facs="tcp:178039:43"/> in all wickedneſſe, and ſaued vs when wee moſt deſerued wrath. Wonder at this you that wonder at nothing, that the Lord would come to bring ſaluation, to redeeme our loſt ſoules euen (as it were) againſt our wils: ſo that now wee would not bee as wee were for a thouſand worlds.</p>
                     <p>The blindneſſe of the Iewes was, and is wonderfull, who heard of their reiection, and of our conuerſion, and yet vnderſtood it not, neither ſought to preuent Gods wrath in reiecting of them. Therefore the Rocke, which ſhould haue ſaued them, ſhiuered them in peeces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was ſhewed their wonderfull blockiſhnes, hauing it ſo often fore-tolde by their Prophets, figured in their lawe, ſhadowed in their ſacrifices, and read in their Churches from ſabbath to ſabbath. Euery thing that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe in Churches, in Common-weales, in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in Countries, in Kingdomes, and in Prouinces; theſe are all fore-tolde in the Scriptures, and yet none do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, ſauing a few choſen ones whom God loueth: For, the comming of Antichriſt, the ouerthrow of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, the darkneſſe of popery, the light of the Goſpell, the conuerſion of the Gentiles, and the reiecting of the Iewes: all theſe are ſet downe in the Scriptures, and yet wee cannot vnderſtand it, though wee heare it day by day, becauſe wee doe not giue our mindes to vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                     <p>Such hearers ſhall ſtand in a maze before the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and terrible throne of God: the dead ſhall riſe, the trumpe ſhall blow, and all the world ſhall be in an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare, and they ſhall ſtand quaking; when their hearing without profiting ſhall bee laid to their charge, and they ſhall ſay: O wee haue knowne no ſuch thing: but ſurely if the Iewes could come out of hell, they would admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs to take better heed how we heare: for we heare as though we did not heare at all, our mindes are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe occupied. Now when wee ſee any thing cometo
<pb facs="tcp:178039:43"/> paſſe as it is fore-told in the ſcriptures, then we muſt ſay as Chriſt ſaid. This prophecie is fulfilled; for all things that are written, are come to <hi>Scriptum eſt, &amp; factum eſt,</hi> that is, as ſure as it is written, ſo ſurely doeth it come to paſſe. It prophecieth nothing but that which truely is fulfilled in due time, and the more often it ſpeakes of a thing, the more certaine, the more excellent, and the more to be beleeued it is. Like a Iewell that is beſet with pearle, ſo is our calling adorned with Scriptures, for ſo doeth God tender our calling, which is often in his mouth, and wee ſo often in his remembrance, that hee ſpeaketh of vs in euerie booke throughout the whole Scriptures, like a kinde ſpouſe whoſe loue is in a ſtrange countrey, and he delighteth himſelfe with thoughts and meditations of her: ſo hee did long vntill the Gentiles were come to him againe, like the prodigall child, whoſe Father did long vntill hee had embraced him. When ſhall my prodigall ſonne come home againe, ſaith hee? <note place="margin">Luke. 15.</note> I will put my beſt garment on his backe, and my golde ring on his finger, and his fare ſhall bee the daintieſt morſell. And thus God longeth for our ſaluation, and hee knocketh at our doores; Is faith heere? is loue heere? is one called the feare of God in this place?</p>
                     <p>And as loue maketh louers ſometime to ſpeake plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and familiarly one to another, ſometime by darke ſpeeches and riddles, ſometime by letters, ſometime by dumbe ſhewes and ſignes, and ſometime to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues one from another: So our God ſpeaketh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time plainely to his Church, ſometime darkely and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically, ſometime hee turneth his face from his Church and deere ſpouſe, as though hee would not ſpeake vnto her for loue, as appeareth in the booke of the Canticles. Of the caſting off of the Iewes, and calling in of the Gentiles; the firſt type or figure was Caine and Abel: Caine was the eldeſt ſonne of Adam, and Abel the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet God loued Abel, and accepted his ſacrifice; but
<pb facs="tcp:178039:44"/> God reiected Caine for his wickednes, and hee became a reprobate. Euen ſo doeth God, hee reiecteth the Iewes which were the eldeſt ſonne, the true Oliue, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſeede, and Gods deere children if they had conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nued in obedience; and he taketh vs being but the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſonne, the wilde Oliue, the ſeede of the wicked, and maketh vs children by adoption vnto him, onely of his mercy without any other cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond example was Sem and Iaphet, both which <note place="margin">Gen. 9. Gen. 5. 1. 2 9. 24 10. 21. &amp;. 11. 10. Gen. 9. 27. Iohn 10. 16.</note> were Noahs ſonnes: Sem was the ſecond ſonne, and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet the firſt, and of this Iaphet came the Gentiles: of him ſaid Noah; <hi>God perſwade Iaphet that he may dwel in the tents of Sem:</hi> that is, that they may be vnited together, as wee ſee it is is come to paſſe. Other ſheepe I haue (ſaith Chriſt) which are not of this fold, them alſo will I bring, and they ſhall beare my voyce, and there ſhall be one ſheepefold, and one ſhepheard.</p>
                     <p>The third type or figure was Iſmael and Iſaac, both the ſonnes of Abraham: Iſmael was the eldeſt, Iſaac the <note place="margin">Gen. 21.</note> younger, yet Iſaac was choſen of God, and enioyed the promiſe, and Iſmael his eldeſt brother a mocker of Iſaac was put away, the Lord was not with him.</p>
                     <p>The fourth type or figure was Iacob and Eſau, both ſonnes to Iſaac: Eſau was the eldeſt brother, &amp; Iacob the <note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note> younger, yet God loued Iacob and hated Eſau, becauſe Eſau contemned his birth-right and ſold it to Iacob for a meſſe of pottage, and therefore Iacob ſtole the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from him: ſo God bleſſed Iacob, but curſed Eſau: wereby is ſhewed, that the Lord did for the contempt of the Iewes, take away their birth-right and their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and hath giuen it vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>The fift type or figure was Leah and Rachel, the two daughters of Laban: Leah was the elder, but bleare or <note place="margin">Gen. 29. 16.</note> ſquint-eyed: Rachel the yonger, beautifull and faire. 17. Therefore Rachel was beloued of Iacob, and Leah de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, 18. Yet Leah was firſt married. 23. And alſo made
<pb facs="tcp:178039:44"/> fruitfull, 31. but Rachel alſo war after maried, 28. and more beloued, 30 and hauing enuied her ſiſters fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, 30. 1. and repented, God remembred her, and made her fruitfull. So Chriſt firſt married the Iewes, and made them glorious; but when they deſpiſed their glory, he married with the Gentiles, and they enuying their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe; of barren in all goodnes, became fruitfull in true holineſſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt figure was Manaſſes and Ephraim, the two ſonnes of Ioſeph: Manaſles was the eldeſt, and Ephraim was the yongeſt. Both of them Joſeph hauing brought to Iacob his Father, that he might bleſſe them, he tooke Manaſſes and put him towards Jacobs right hand, that he might bleſſe him firſt and more plentifully, and hee tooke Ephraim and put him towards Iacobs left hand. But Iacob ſtretched out his right hand and laide it vpon Ephraims head which was the yonger, and his left hand vpon Manaſſes, directing his hands ſo of purpoſe, for Manaſſes was the elder of them. Thus the Lord bleſſed vs when there was no hope left for vs.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth figure was Rahab a harlot in Iericho, who was a Gentile, yet her heart was touched ſo, that ſhe <note place="margin">Ioſ. 2.</note> receiued and entertained the ſpies that Iſrael ſent, and in time of danger hid them, that they ſhould take no harme: ſignifying thereby, that the Gentiles ſhould receiue and embrace the Iſraelites and meſſengers of the Goſpel, and keepe them as ſafely, and defend them as diligently as Rahab did the ſpies of Iſrael.</p>
                     <p>The eight figure was Ruth a Moabite: of her <hi>Chriſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ruth 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Ieſus</hi> vouchſafed to come as concerning the fleſh, to ſhew that he came not onely of the Iewes, and for the Iewes, but alſo of and for the Gentiles, which were the loſt ſheepe, vnhoped for, being ſtrangers from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.</p>
                     <p>The ninth figure was Sampſon, who being a Iew, <note place="margin">Iudg. 14.</note> would needes marry with a Gentile; ſignifying that
<pb facs="tcp:178039:45"/> 
                        <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> would alſo marry with the Gentiles, as he did with the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>The tenth figure was Salomon who married Pharaos daughter, which was an Egyptian and Gentile, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1. Reg. 11.</note> therby, that Chriſt would take him a ſpouſe among the Gentiles to marry with himſelfe, as Dauid in the <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.</note> Pſalmes declareth.</p>
                     <p>The eleuenth figure was Naaman the Syrian, whoſe leproſie is turned vpon Gehezie, the leproſie of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <note place="margin">2. Reg. 5.</note> and ignorant man turned vpon an Iſraelite, and one that had the knowledge of God, being the ſeruant of a Prophet: ſignifying that our leproſie of ſinne and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhould be turned from vs vpon the Iewes, who had the knowledge of the law of God, but eſteemed it not, but were vnthankfull for it. Many like examples there are in the new Teſtament. For like as the Cherubins, though ſeuered in ſunder, yet looked one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and both vpon the mercie-ſeate: ſo the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the new, looke one towards another, and yet point at one and the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>The firſt type or figure in the newe Teſtament, was the Wiſe-men, which were the firſt fruits of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <note place="margin">Mar. 2.</note> and came from the Eaſt, being guided by a ſtatre: ſignifying that by the guiding of the word and ſpirit of God, the Gentiles ſhould come from all the places of the world to embrace <hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> with ioy.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond type or figure was Chriſt his going into Egypt, ſignifying thereby, that he ſhould goe from the Iewes to the Gentiles, becauſe the Iewes refuſed him, through vnbeliefe, abundance of wickedneſſe, &amp; want <note place="margin">Math. 2.</note> of reformation: ſo we ſee that nothing can driue away Chriſt but ſinne.</p>
                     <p>The third type was Chriſt whipping the Iewes out of the Temple, ſhewing thereby that the Jewes ſhould bee <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 12.</note> whipped or caſt out of the ſpirituall Temple; and the Gentiles ſhould occupie it. This (beloued) belongeth
<pb facs="tcp:178039:45"/> vnto vs, to whom the Lord ſo wonderfully hath made his light to ſhine.</p>
                     <p>The fourth figure is the parable of the Vineyard, that <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 33.</note> was taken from them that poſſeſſed it, &amp; giuen to them that ſhould bring forth the fruits thereof, and yeeld bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter increaſe vnto the Lord of the vineyard.</p>
                     <p>The fift figure was the parable of the two ſonnes that were bidden to goe &amp; worke in their fathers vineyard, <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 28.</note> of whom the firſt ſaid he would, and did not: the ſecond ſaid, he would not, and did repent, and went to labour in the vineyard: the firſt ſignified the Iewes which made many vowes, with ſuch a ſhew of godlineſſe which was but hypocriſie, whom the Lord reiected and caſt off and ſaid, that the Publicans and ſinners ſhould ſtand in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to condemne the greateſt of them.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt figure was the feaſt that the Lord made vnto <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 2.</note> the diſobedient gueſts, whom the Lord inuited to his banquet, which was onely ordained for them, and who promiſed to come vnto it, and yet refuſed &amp; would not come, but alledged ſlight excuſes taken from their loue of earthly and tranſitory things aboue God. Therefore the Lord ſent into the hie waies to call and compell the Gentiles to come, which came, though ſome left their wedding garments behind them.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth type or figure was the viſion of Peter in Joppa, when he was on the top of the houſe, where hee <note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> ſaw the veſſell come downe that had in it all manner of foure footed beaſts of the earth, and wilde beaſtes, and fowles of the ayre, and creeping things, where alſo the voyce ſaid vnto him, <hi>Ariſe Peter, kill and eat:</hi> wherein the Lord ſhewed vnto him, that hee ſhould count no man vncleane, although the Gentiles then were counted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, as were the vncleane beaſts ſet downe in the law of God, therefore when Peter was ſent for, to Cornelius houſe, hee ſaide, <hi>Of a truth I perceiue that God hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, but in euery natto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he that feareth God &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verſe. 34.</note>
                        <pb facs="tcp:178039:46"/> 
                        <hi>righteouſneſſe is accepted of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many other examples of our calling, as the ſtraied <note place="margin">Luke 15. Luk. 5.</note> ſheepe, the loſt groat, the prodigall ſonne, and Chriſt eating with Publicans &amp; ſinners, which when we reade we ſhould caſt our figure and ſay, Of whom is this ſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken? of the Gentiles? then is it of mee, for I am a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. But am I conuerted? if I be not, then haue I not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this prophecie: therefore let vs ſtriue to doe well, and to mortifie &amp; ſubdue ſinne which dwelleth in our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies, for none but the valiant can enter into the kingdome of heauen.</p>
                     <p>Now all theſe prophecies are ſulfilled, the blinde ſee, the lame goe, the dumbe ſpeake, the deafe heare, the maimed worke, the dead are quickened, the leapers are cleanſed, and the poore receiue the Goſpell. Therefore who wil deſpaire and ſay, light is not reuealed vnto me, when as he ſeeth it to be reuealed vnto whole Nations? And ſo ſolemne is our calling, as that in ſo many places of the ſcripture it is foretold, whereby we ſee how deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord tendreth our ſaluation, like as a kind ſpouſe which was longed for, while ſhe was in a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, for Chriſt longed for the Gentiles, till they came home againe vnto him. Therefore let vs now conſider what he giueth vs, namely, righteouſnes and ſaluation: firſt righteouſnes, then ſaluation: firſt repentance, and then forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, the Sun of the Goſpell, leſt we ſhould ſee heauen in hell, and light in darkneſſe, and ioy in anguiſhes. Let vs not contemne our light, or grow careleſſe of it: let vs not build with one hand, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw with the other by profaneneſſe, like thoſe men which while they ſurfetted at their gluttenous tables, called vpon God for health. Chriſt is not receiued with the left hand: if the Father offering a gift, do ſee the Son ſtretch foorth his left hand, hee will withdraw his gift from him. I ſay, let vs not contemne our light as the Iewes contemned their glory.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:178039:46"/>
                     <p>For what is light to him that will ſhut his eies againſt is? What is this light? It is ſuch a glorious light, and <note place="margin">Natth. 13.</note> ſuch an excellent reuelation, that great and mightie Kings haue earneſtly deſired to ſee, and Princes haue laid down their crownes to reueale it. Let vs embrace this light, let vs take and put on the wedding garment, and goe to the banquet, vnto which a thouſand meſſengers haue inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, and alledge none excuſes: ſay not, <hi>I haue marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wife, I haue bought Oxen, I goe to ſee a Farme, &amp;c. and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>therefore I cannot come,</hi> neither wil I come. Well, do ſo, if that yee will needes: but remember that thou waſt inuited, and therefore the bleſſing ſhall bee giuen to another: and Eſau ſhall weepe for the bleſſing, but ſhall not <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> haue it.</p>
                     <p>But giue mee a reaſon I pray thee, why thou wilt bee called the ſeruant of God which doſt not ſerue him, or the childe of God, which doſt not loue him; or the diſciple of Chriſt, which doſt not learne of him: yet his raine falleth vpon all, iuſt and vniuſt, and hee giueth thee all things for nothing: The Sunne doth giue his light for nothing, the dew doth giue his moiſture for nothing, the riuers doth giue their waters for nothing; and the earth doth giue her fruit for nothing.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall wee doe then when the Sunne ſhineth? <note place="margin">Rom. 13. Epheſ. 5.</note> Wee muſt not doe as wee doe in the darke, for then men ought to betake them to their labour. Learne of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage beaſts who as ſoone as the day ſprings, betake them to their trauell, and euery bird welcommeth it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſweete ſong. Chriſt is light, and this light is come: therefore hee that ſeeth not now is blinde. Are not they then blind which yet ſee not that praier for the dead is vaine, needleſſe, and booteleſſe? But thicke darkeneſſe haue a mighty light to chaſe it away. So that hee which beginneth to roote out ſome error or ſuperſtition, at the firſt ſhall haue much adoe, for cuſtome and naturall corruption are the firſt cauſers of hereſie, and ſhall crie
<pb facs="tcp:178039:47"/> againſt her in the maintenance thereof: and withſtanders of reformation ſhall ſay, Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of Epheſus: and ſo for a long time they ſeeme to waſh the <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> or the blacke Moore, the more they waſh him the more they gall him, and yet hee is an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> ſtill: but in the end the Arke ſtandeth, and <hi>Dagon</hi> falleth downe: and truth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth ouer falſhood, hauing got the victorie; and light chaſeth away darkneſſe with the brightneſſe thereof. Why <note place="margin">1. Sam. 5. 8</note> then doth this darkeneſſe continue amongſt vs ſtill? To him that asketh, what Scrpture haue you againſt it? it is ſufficient to anſwer, what Scripture haue you for it? For if the word command it not, God reiecteth it, and will ſay, who hath required theſe things at your hands? But what is this? for euery idle word you muſt giue account, as our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt ſaith, Matth. 12. And whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne, Rom. 14. 23. They aske, what, ſhall wee not ſay God bee with them? Why ſhould you? Why (ſay they) muſt wee ſay nothing? What if thou doe not? What ſaieſt thou, when thou mentioneſt the death of thy firſt fathers, <hi>Adam, Seth, Enos, Enoch, Noah?</hi> Doeſt thou leſſe loue theſe, not praying for them, then thou doeſt them for whom thou ſaieſt, God be with them? &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But thou haſt ſpeeches enow to vſe, if thou wilt needes ſay ſomewhat, and leaue ſuch ſuperſtitious and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue ſentences: if hee bee a good man, thou maieſt ſay, the Lord bee thanked for his deliuerance, or the like: but if hee bee not, then thou maieſt ſay, God grant wee may doe better then hee hath done, and that by his fall we may learne to riſe, from ſinne, or ſome ſuch thing: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee bee, thou maieſt ſay as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid of his childe, giuing a reaſon why hee would not pray for him any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger benig dead: Can I call him backe againe? I ſhall goe to him, but hee ſhall not returne to mee: or any other words, ſo they bee wiſe, and therefore not againſt the word. What then is to bee done? As <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid to his
<pb facs="tcp:178039:47"/> wiues and children; Giue me your idols that I may bury them: ſo ſay I vnto you; giue mee your ſuperſtitions that I may bury them, that they may remaine with you, or in you no longer, to the diſhonour of God, offending of your weake brethren, or to my griefe. For I am iealous ouer you, and becauſe you are mine, and I am yours; O that my voice were as the whitle-winde, to beat downe, roote out, and blow away all your ſuperſtitions, that they may no longer raigne amongſt you: or rather, O that Chriſt which is our light were come into vs all, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo bright, that wee were aſhamed of all our darknes: of all, not of mind onely, but of will alſo, and of workes, that wee no longer would walk in darknes, for few haue the wil to walke according to the word, either in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or light: wee can ſee to ſinne in the darke aſwell as in the light, and doe rather, becauſe the light diſcouereth both the harlot and the theefe, ſo they are afraide of the light; but aſſured bee wee, where light is not, Chriſt is not: for Chriſt is light; and let none bee afraid to ſeeke this light, which is ſo good, ſo excellent, and ſo profitable for <note place="margin">Iohn 1.</note> vs. For it doth not onely deſcrie it ſelfe, but all other things round about it. Therefore if thou haue this light, thy faith, thy feare, thy loue will ſhew it ſelfe, and good things cannot now hide themſelues, for hee that is light doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to pleaſe God in the light. It is no maruell though a man ſtumble in the darke, but hee which ſtumbleth in the light is not very ſtrong, becauſe hee ſeeth his way before him. Once we ſtumbled at euery ſtraw when we walked in darkeneſſe, for then wrath had a fall, pride had a fall, luſt had a fall, drunkenneſſe had a fall, penurie had a fall, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had a fall: or if you will, pride roſe, and wee fell; luſt roſe, and we fell, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Were <hi>Aegypt</hi> as light as <hi>Goſhen</hi> wee ſhould haue Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as ioyfull as true worſhippers; but there is palpable darkeneſſe, tedious, fearefull, and of long continuance in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> cleare light onely in <hi>Goſhen:</hi> therefore flie <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:178039:48"/> but if thou liue in Aegipt, that is, walke in darkneſſe, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit wickedneſſe, though thou ſinne in the darke, the light will bewray thee, and thy conſcience will accuſe thee, and condemne thee for it. Therefore now giue ouer darkeneſſe, and arme thee with light, for our life ſhineth like the light, therefore now we ſhould be <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for <hi>Iſrael</hi> is reuolted.</p>
                     <p>But many Scrouls may bee written of our ſinnes, and thus the Gentiles are as Gentiles ſtill. Hee that beleeueth not the word, is an Infidell: he that beleeueth not God, is an Atheiſt: he that worſhippeth any thing more then God, is an Idolater: euery mans conſcience ſhall condemne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Yet men will leaue godlineſſe for riches, but they will not leaue riches for godlineſſe. What madneſſe? Yea the Iewes neuer ſerued God at any time with ſuch deuotion as many doe now their gold and their riches: O intollerable wickedneſſe? For many there are that could be content neuer to die, but liue euer heere with their riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurs.</p>
                     <p>And is not the godly more deſpited for his godlines, then the wicked for his wickedneſſe?</p>
                     <p>Are not the members of Chriſt more hated, and worſe entertained by vs, then the limbes of ſatan? So dearely euery one loues ſinne, and drawes ſinne vpon ſinne, till their be a chaine of many links and monſters therein drawn moſt lothſome. And though wee of our ſelues run ſwiftly to hell, yet the moſt driue vs, to make vs hie faſter: they come vnto vs, and ſay, your fathers loued vs well, and ſaid vnto vs, if you will bee faire, you ſhall be wiſe; if you will be drunke, you ſhall be rich, &amp;c. Yea euery one pointeth, and ſhweth vs the way that leadeth to deſtruction: and how few are the number of them that do ſhew vs the way of vertue and golidneſſe.</p>
                     <p>And thus wee are euen as froward as thoſe Iewes that ſtriue who ſhall come into hell firſt. Who did euer thanke God that he was not borne an hundred yeeres agoe, when ignorance ſpred ouer all, and all <hi>Aegypt</hi> was ſmitten with
<pb facs="tcp:178039:48"/> darkneſſe? or that the Lord hath nor left him to himſelfe to become an Atheiſt, or an Epicure, which liues without God in the world? We haue all Gods gifts offered vs, but we haue refuſed them. Chriſt brought light, but wee had rather he had brought darknes, for we loue darkneſſe more then light. The Angels, the heauens, the word, the ſpirit, are light, and we that ſee it, are darkneſſe, for we cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide light, but are like an Owle that flieth out of a bare field from the light of the day, ſuch a death is day vnto vs. Faith is flowne away, truth is become a pilgrime, and euery ſtring is out of tune. He that ſhould weepe and be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, laughes: and truth is brought to the ground, yea poore truth is peſecuted to death: but ſinners are ſtubble, and their ſentence is, Burne them.</p>
                     <p>How fine would be the way of vertue, if you would pare away the rubs that are in it, if you would take away all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſinne, and giue it gall to eate, and when you haue done ſo, ſet a crowne of thornes vpon the head thereof, and when you haue thus crowned it, make it carrie the croſſe, and when it hath carried the croſſe, condemne it, and when you haue condemned it, put it to death, and when ye haue put it to death, burie it; and when you haue buried it role a great ſtone vpon the head of it, and ſet watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to keepe it, euen faſting and praier, that it may neuer ariſe againe to raigne any more; the which the Lord for his mercy ſake grant.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heard the ſweet ſong of old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Simeon,</hi> like the pleaſant ſong a ſweet bird before her death, ſetting forth the ioy of the righteous that embrace Chriſt Ieſus. Before Chriſt Ieſus vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to come to vs, we would not come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but in all our doings we wrought our condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and through the innumerable heaps of our iuiquities, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to driue him without all hope of mercy from vs. So wee continued like flies, which flutter about the candle till they haue conſumed themſelues. When wee had done as much as in vs lay to driue him away from vs, then hee ſaued vs, and recompenced good for euill vnto vs. So that if God had loued vs no more then wee loued our ſelues, wee might haue periſhed in our ſinnes, and our blood ſhould haue beene vpon our owne heads. Jf Chriſt bee the light of the Gentiles, let vs embrace him, and euery one walke as becommeth the children of light: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie doe ſhut their eies againſt it, leſt they ſhould ſee, and not onely many ſmother their owne light, but the Sunne ſaith vnto the Moone, ſhine not; and the Moone
<pb facs="tcp:178039:49"/> ſaith vnto the ſtars be not bright. And many haue ſmoothred their light ſo long, that the dampe hath put out the candle; and thus they labour to bring the darkeneſſe of <hi>Aegypt</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Goſhen:</hi> ſo that their eies haue forgotten to ſee, and ſomany goe cut of the way, becauſe they would not looke vpon the candle, and the diuell giueth to euery one that which hee wiſheth, ſo it may bee for his hurt. But who can but pitty, that with the ſame Manna which commeth from heauen and feedeth many of life euerlaſting, ſo many are poiſoned and find in it nothing but fauour of eternall death?</p>
                  <p>The Iewes had no cauſe to enuie our light, for he gaue them glory: hee was poore, and yet hee gaue them riches: hee was counted baſe, and yet hee made them honourable: hee was contemned, and yet he made them beloued: they were full of darkeneſſe, and hee brought them light; but they contemned his light, and ſo procured their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. And therefore now it is come to paſſe, that they are become vagabonds vpon the earth, and moſt contemned of all other Nations, and euery people haue a dwelling, whereas ſince they prophecied euill vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſaying; His blood bee vpon vs and our children, goodneſſe hath put on the face of baſhfulneſſe amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Jf thou embrace Chriſt as <hi>Simeon</hi> did, the Chriſt is thy glory; but if thy glory conſiſt in beautie, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; in gay cloth, which weareth; in wealth, which waſteth; or in gold, which ruſteth; then Chriſt is not thy glorie.</p>
                  <p>Wee haue gone long with an old man, and now we haue loſt him, but we are loth to part with him, he is ſuch a good companion, neuertheleſſe wee hope to finde him againe in <hi>Ionah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee haue gone but ſlowly with him, as with an old man that is not very ſwift of foote; but now we muſt runne with <hi>Ionah</hi> as with a Poſt, leſt Niniuie be deſtroied.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb facs="tcp:178039:50"/>The Prophecie of Ionah.</q>
                  <p>J neede not to ſhew the authority of Prophets: but concerning their ſorts and differences, there are three ſorts of Prophets. The firſt were ſuch, as called vpon the name of the Lord in praier for the people, and receiued an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from the Lord in the peoples behalfe: of which ſort <note place="margin">1. Sam. 10. 9.</note> was <hi>Samuel,</hi> and theſe were called Seers. A ſecond ſort of Prophets were ſuch as God raiſed to expound the Law, and declare the will of God vnto the people, when the prieſt and ſuch as ſhould doe ſo, were ſlacke in their callings, of which ſort was <hi>Eſay, Ieremy, Ezechiel, Daniel, Hoſea, Ioel, Amos, Obediah,</hi> and the reſt of the holy Prophets. A third ſort were ſuch as haue beene ſince Chriſt, working ſuch like effects, of which ſort was the Prophet <hi>Agabus</hi> of whom mention is made in the 11. of the Acts, and 28. verſe.</p>
                  <p>Now in the ſecond ſort of theſe, was <hi>Ionah,</hi> whom God ſent to declare his will to his people, vnto whom alſo the Lord did reueale the ſuberſion of kingdomes, the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Tribes, the captiuitie of Nations, the calamities that were to come vnto the ſonnes of men for iniquitie and rebellion againſt God.</p>
                  <p>As all wiſe men were not borne at once, nor liued toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo theſe holy Prophets haue not beene at once, but were raiſed vp by the Lord God, ſome here ſome there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure, and as hee ſaw the people ſtand in need of them, by reaſon of the corruption of the times.</p>
                  <p>And furthermore, the Lord hath not at any time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto one of theſe, all things that might bee reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but as much as ſufficient for them euery one in their times and places. Neither hath any of them told as much of the will of God as might bee declared; nor fully expounded his Lawes: but the Patriarkes left ſome to the Prophets, and the Prophets left ſome to the Apoſtles, but they haue left none for vs, but they haue all ſet open the whole will of God vnto vs, and euery Prophet now
<pb facs="tcp:178039:50"/> bringeth only golde, myrthe and frankencenſe, like the wiſe men that came to ſee our Lord.</p>
                  <p>There are three things that mooued mee to take this ſtory in hand aboue all others. Firſt, becauſe you know the ſtory, and therefore can the better conceiue of the matter, as I goe forward with it. Secondly, becauſe it is briefe, and doth containe a great deale in a little. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it is moſt agreeable for the time and ſtate of this ſinful age wherein we liue, and therefore moſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enient for vs. Jt is manifeſt that <hi>Ionah</hi> lined in a very troubleſome time, namely, in the time of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſoune of <hi>Ioaſh</hi> King of Iſrael, a wicked King, though not hee that is called the <hi>Ieroboam</hi> that made Iſrael to ſinne. For of this ſecond <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> in whoſe time he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, it is written, 2. King. 14. 24. he departed not from any of the ſinnes of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin; which commendeth the holineſſe of <hi>Ionah,</hi> in that he in the middeſt of the corruption wherewithall the people were ouerflowne, was vncorrupted and vnſpotted, and called to be a Prophet amongſt the people of God. For he had prophecied in <hi>Iſrael</hi> before he was ſent to Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, as the word alſo doth argue; which laieth open and magnifieth the great loue of God, in that he ſent a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <note place="margin">2. Reg. 14 25.</note> to admoniſh this vngodly people, when as hee ſhould haue ſent a thunder-bolt to terrifie them, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vtterly to deſtroy them; ſo that there mercy ſtept before iudgement.</p>
                  <p>His name was <hi>Ionah,</hi> which ſignifieth a Doue, which admoniſheth vs, that as we labour to be as wiſe as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, ſo we ſhould alſo deſire that we might be as ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as Doues. his fathers name was Amittai, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth truth. I would that Truth were euery Preachers father.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſpeciall things contained in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt, the great mercy of God ſhewed vnto three ſorts of men: the Niniuites, <hi>Ionah,</hi> and the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb facs="tcp:178039:51"/> in reſpect of the Niniuites, that he ſent a Prophet to Niniuie, a Citie of the Gentiles, which were ſtrangers from the couenant, from the promiſe, &amp; ſtrangers, from the common wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and conuerted them by his preaching, and ſo ſpared them now.</p>
                  <p>In regard of <hi>Ionah,</hi> that being, for his diſobedience in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> flying to <hi>Tariſh,</hi> when he was ſent to Niniuie, throwne into the ſea, he prepared a great whale to ſwallow him, and in his belly, euen in the bottome of the Sea, where there was no hope of life for him, preſerued him: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three dayes deliuered him thence ſafe, and then caſt him not off, but continued him in his calling, &amp; wrought powerfully by him, both in the ſhip, conuerting the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Mariners, and in Niniuie, humbling the King and the whole City.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, when he had moſt vnworthily doubly murmured and iuſtifie himſelfe againſt God, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> himſelfe with gentle and milde reproofe of him. In conſideration of the Mariners, that hauing been idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all their liues, &amp; now in daunger, giuing the honor of God to their owne fancies, God yet conuerteth them, ſo that they called vpon him, and ſacrified, and made vowes vnto the true God, and by his mighty power, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the winde and ſeas calmed, were then and for euer ſaued.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is <hi>Ionahs</hi> fall, and riſing againe. His fall, firſt ſinning, both flying from God, &amp; murmuring, and therein iuſtifying himſelfe: ſecondly, ſuſtaining his puniſhment, manifold and long feares, caſting into the ſea, and continuing in the Whales belly three daies, and afterward his reproofe and conuiction. His riſing, firſt repenting in the ſhip, in the belly of the Whale, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt out of it. Then alſo faithfully diſcharging his duety, crying againſt Niniuie couragiouſly.</p>
                  <p>We haue ſeene <hi>Ionah</hi> a far off, if we would wee might ſee him neerer. He that receiues a Prophet in the name
<pb facs="tcp:178039:51"/> of a Prophet, ſhall receiue a prophets reward. Therefore let vs prepare our eares to heare, and receiue the word of God preached by the Miniſters, and let vs thinke that <hi>Ionah</hi> is come againe to our houſes to preach, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be 40. daies, or 40. weekes, or 40. yeeres, they that liue like Sodome, ſhall be puniſhed like Sodome. But as our Sauiour ſaith to his diſciples, <hi>Pray that your flight be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>not in winter, nor on the Sabbath:</hi> ſo ſay I vnto you, pray that the Lords comming be not on the weeke daies, for if he come then, how ſhould he find you? Therefore J pray you learn at leaſt now, and giue good eare, that you may heare ſufficient for all the weeke.</p>
                  <q>The word of the Lord came to Ionah the ſonne of Amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai, ſaying: Ariſe and goe to Niniuie, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Herein I obſerue, that <hi>Ionah</hi> went not before he was ſent: for going to preach vnto the Gentiles, it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that he ſhould haue a ſpeciall calling and commiſſion from the Lord himſelfe: for it was vnmeete to caſt the childrens bread vnto the dogges, vnleſſe he had a ſpeciall commandement from God ſo to doe.</p>
                  <p>None ought to take vpon him the function of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the Church, vnleſſe they haue their warrant or authority from Gods, as Aaron had. And although they <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> haue not their authoritie in that forme and manner as <hi>Ionah</hi> had his, (namely,) as it were by word of mouth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from God himſelfe, <hi>Ariſe and goe to Niniuie:</hi> yet they muſt haue their warrant from him, elſe their calling is vnlawfull.</p>
                  <p>But now heere is another authority crept into the Church, that makes ſo many Idolls, which haue eyes and ſee not, tongues and ſpeak not, eares and heare not, and that is this, when one ſtalleth vp another into Moiſes chaire, not hauing Moſes rodde, nor Moſes ſpirit. But this gall will not hold ſpurring. Further I obſerue, that as the word of the Lord came to <hi>Ionah:</hi> ſo the word of
<pb facs="tcp:178039:52"/> the Pope came to his Prieſts, Ieſuits, &amp; Seminaries, but ſo and in ſuch ſort many times, that they are drawne to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>borne while maſſes are ſaid for them at Rome.</p>
                  <q>The word of the Lord came vnto Ionah, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>That which came vnto him was not alwaies with him, but ſo it was, that when the word of the Lord came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of the Prophets, then they were well furniſhed with abilitie to teach, to preach, to reprooue, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund whoſoeuer the Lord would haue ſo handled. As by example: Nathan the Prophet did Dauid the King, that hee ſhould build a Temple, 2. Sam. 7. and 1. <note place="margin">2. Sam. 7. 1. Chron. 17.</note> Chron. 17. And a litle after he came and bid him that he ſhould not build it. Where we ſee, that when he bid him build it, then the Spirit of the Lord came not vnto him to bid him ſo to doe. And therefore the Spirit of God came vnto him the very ſame night, and bid him that he ſhould goe to Dauid, and bid him that he ſhould not build it. For this is euident, that as God himſelfe is conſtant, ſo his Spirit and his word are conſtant, and therefore neuer ſaith and vnſaith one thing.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the Prophet Eliſha ſaid, 2. King 4. that the Shunamites heart was grieued, but the Lord had hid it <note place="margin">2. King. 4.</note> from him: and had not as then declared the ſame vnto him: which doth note vnto vs, that the ſame word whereby the Lord hath, and doeth reueale maruellous things vnto the Prophets, was not now vpon him, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is alwaies vpon any Prophet, but according to the will of God it comes vnto them, to reueale vnto them what he would haue them to doe, and when it pleaſeth him.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Daniel ſaid, that the Lord did not reneale the Kings dreame vnto him, for any wiſdome that hee had <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 30.</note> more then any liuing, but onely for the Kings ſake, and for the poore people of Gods ſake: and ſo you muſt thinke of vs that are the Miniſters of the Goſpell, that the Lord doeth not reueale his will vnto vs, for any wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:178039:52"/> or worthines that is in vs, more then other men, but for your ſakes, &amp; that we might reueale it to you. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heare vs euen for this cauſe, becauſe the Lord hath reuealed vnto vs theſe things for your ſakes and good.</p>
                  <p>From the calling we come to the charge.</p>
                  <q>Ariſe and goe to Niniue that great, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>God commeth and findeth vs all aſleepe, then he bids vs ariſe; for they are not fit to conuert others, which are not yet conuerted themſelues, according to that ſaying of Chriſt to Peter: When thou art conuerted, ſtrengthen <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 30.</note> thy brethren, teaching them by your experience.</p>
                  <p>Now adaies men take vpon them to reprooue others for committing ſuch things as themſelues haue practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and do practiſe without amendement, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their diligence in teaching others their dutie; they can teach all the doctrine of Chriſt ſauing three ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that is, <hi>Fellow me.</hi> Therefore theſe are like ſome Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors which are very buſie in decking and tricking vp of others, but goe both bare and beggerly themſelues. Yet they will not let vs plucke out the more that is in their eyes, vntill wee haue plucked out the beame which is in our owne eyes.</p>
                  <q>Go to Niniuie.</q>
                  <p>Niniuie was the greateſt and the antienteſt Citie in the land of Aſſyria, and the name of it ſignified <hi>Beautifull,</hi> which name was giuen it, rather for the greatneſſe and beautie thereof,, then for the name of Aſhur, which, was the builder and firſt founder thereof, as we reade in the booke of Geneſis. It had a faire name, but foule deedes, like this Citie. <note place="margin">Gen. 10. 12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <q>Goeto Niniuie, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>God would not ſuffer any people to bee vntaught; therefore he hath written this name in great letters, eaſie to bee read of all. The heauens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth the work of his hands. They haue no ſpeech nor language, without them is their <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 1. 2. 3.</note>
                     <pb facs="tcp:178039:53"/> voyce heard. Their line is gone foorth through all the earth, &amp; their words into the ends of the world. In them <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19. 20.</note> is manifeſt for all what may bee knowne of God. For his eternall power and God head are ſeene by the creation of the world: but eſpecially hee teacheth ſome by his word alſo. Therefore he ſent vnto the old world Noah, <note place="margin">Gen. 6. Gen. 19. Act. 16. 6.</note> Lot to Sodome, Moiſes to Iſrael, and heere <hi>Ionah</hi> to Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuie. But when Paul with Silas and Timothy had gone throughout Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden of the Holy ghoſt to preach the word in Aſia. Then came they to Myſia, and ſought to goe into Bithynia, but the ſpirit ſuffered them not.</p>
                  <q>Goe to Niniuie.</q>
                  <p>The Iewes would not heare the wod of God by <hi>Ionah,</hi> and therefore the Lord ſent him to Niniuie. They that griue the ſpirit, quench the ſpirit. Then goes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from Samaria to Niniuie. The word was in Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, it went thence to Niniuie: the Goſpell was at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, it is come into England: it is gone out of the Citie, <note place="margin">Reu. 2. 4. 5. 1. Cor. 10. 12.</note> but it may depart from England againe. If any thinke that he ſtandeth, let him take heede left he fall.</p>
                  <p>But the Prophet goes from Samaria to Niniuie, that was, both to ſhake off the duſt of his feete, to witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them their obſtinacie and hardnes of heart: and ſecondly, to let them ſee that the wicked Gentiles were more righteous then they, in that they repented at the voyce of one Prophet; yea and that with one ſermon: whereas themſelues refuſed, and reſiſted all the holy and worthy Prophets that God ſent vnto them. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may bee to ſignifie, that the Iewes for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and negligence ſhould be reiected: and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould be receiued into the fauor of God, that they might bee an holy and ſanctified people vnto the Lord in their trouble.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb facs="tcp:178039:53"/>That great Citie.</q>
                  <p>Niniuie had fifteen hundred towers in it, as ſome doe <note place="margin">Ion 2. 4. 11.</note> write, and a hundred &amp; twenty thouſand little children (as it is noted in the end of this ſtory) therefore it may well be called a great City: but the greater it was, the more vngodly it was. For as one man taketh ſickneſſe of another: ſo one man is infected by the wicked wordes and ill example of another, and ſo taught to ſinne the more, till the meaſure of ſinne be full.</p>
                  <q>And cry againſt it, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Firſt God biddeth him; Ariſe and ſhake off all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, &amp; then to goe and call them to the battell, and now he bids him cry out againſt them, and ſo terrifie them. Euery Prophet is a crier, as appeareth where the Lord biddeth Eſay to lift vp his voice like a trumpet. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <note place="margin">Eſay 48. 1.</note> Prophet muſt both bee plaine and bold, and this many times maketh the poore ſeruants of God to ſpeake their mindes as plaine and bold, as if they ſate in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Iohn</hi> was a voyce, a voyce would not ſerue; he was <note place="margin">Luk. 3.</note> the voice of a cryer, and yet hee could not make all the crooked ſtraight, nor the rough plaine.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe all the Preachers of the Goſpell ſhould cry, that is, preach zealouſly, in the ſecond of the Actes it is written; The Holy ghoſt came downe in fire and tongues: but this fire is quenched, and the tongues are tied vp, ſo that they that ſhould cry are ſtarke dumbe: but though they cannot ſpeake, they can ſee, they can ſee if a great benefice fall, though it be an hundred miles off: and Pharaoh had more care of his ſheepe, then wee haue of our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>If Preachers were not deafe, they needed not to crie one to another; but ſuch is the dumbneſſe of Preachers, and the deafenes of all ſorts of hearers, that there is great ſlowneſſe of followers, ſo that there is but little good done, and but a few fruits gathered.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:178039:54"/>
                  <p>If ye were not deafe, we neede not to crie, but becauſe yee be dull of hearing, therefore wee cry with mouth, with heart, with hand, with foote, and with all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our bodies vnto you, and yet how little do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it? But are not ye commanded to heare as well as we to cry? Yet the cocke croweth when men are aſleep, <note place="margin">Mat. 36. 70. 72. 74. Prou. 28. 9.</note> yea the cocke croweth, and ſtill Peter yet denieth his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Before you cry vnto the Lord, heare what the word crieth vnto you, and let not your workes crie for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance while your tongues cry for mercie.</p>
                  <p>When men heare the Preacher ſpeake againſt pride, hypocriſie, couetouſneſſe, or anie other ſinne, then they looke one vpon another, as though it belonged not vnto them: but who can ſay his heart is cleane?</p>
                  <q>And cry againſt it.</q>
                  <p>Our ſins buffet God on euerie ſide, as the Iewes, buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted Chriſt, firſt on the right ſide, then on the left ſide, and neuer leaue till they haue prouoked him to cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. When God cries, then we ſhould weepe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering wherefore hee cries: for there is nothing that can prouoke the Lord to cry but ſinne, and that hee euer crieth againſt. Doe what you will, and ſay what you will, and the Lord will not be offended with you, vnleſſe you ſinne: but if you commit ſinne, he is iuſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not leaue til he hath by crying ſlaine either you, or ſinne, that raignes in you. For as an angrie man euer purſueth that which he hateth, vntill he hath deſtroied it: ſo the Lord croſſeth and followeth vs with his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vntill he hath ſlaine that which moſt deadly hee hateth, ſinne.</p>
                  <q>And cry againſt it, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Reproofe is the neceſſarieſt office, yet is it leaſt regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yea moſt abhorred. For now wee thinke if one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue vs, he hateth vs. But the Lord ſaith, Leuiticus 19. Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, thou ſhalt <note place="margin">Le. 19. 17.</note>
                     <pb facs="tcp:178039:54"/> reproue him, &amp; ſuffer him not to ſinne: noting thereby, that if we flatter any in their ſinne, or ſee them ſinne, and not reproue them for it, it is a manifeſt ſigne that we doe it of hatred, how great loue and good will ſoeuer wee pretend toward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſeeing the matter tends to the hurt of their ſoules, and the offence of God.</p>
                  <p>Yea, if a Preacher reproue ſinne, he is thought to doe it of hatred, or of ſome particular grudge: and to be too buſie, too bitter, too ſharpe, too rough, and therefore ſay, he ſhould preach Gods loue and mercy, for he is a Preacher of the goſpell, he tells vs of, &amp; threatens with the law, and ſo throwes vs downe too low, ſome to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire: as though we preached the law onely, or chiefly, and not the Goſpel alſo continually, to them that loath and ſtriue againſt their ſinnes, though they ſinne gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly. Others, as though they were galled, will ſay, let him keep his text, or they will ſay, he is beſide his booke: as though no text in Scripture reproued ſinne, and ſo of all doctrines, the doctrine of reproofe and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinne, is moſt contemned, and leaſt eſteemed. But let a Preacher preach darke myſteries, or prophane ſpeeches, or vnprofitable fables, or friuolous queſtions, or curious inuentions, or odde conceits, or braine-ſicke dreames, and any of theſe will be more welcome vnto them then reprehenſion, which is moſt profitable and neceſſarieſt of all. Balaams Aſſe neuer ſpake but once, and then he reproued. Then if Balaams Aſſe reproued Balaam, how much more ought Balaam to reprooue <note place="margin">Num. 22. 28.</note> Aſſes, or ſuch as will be no otherwiſe then beaſts in their behauiour? But perſwade your ſelues beloued, which is moſt true, though we ſpeake as if we were angry with you, and threaten as if we would hurt you, and crie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you as if we hated you, yet we loue you in the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt blood we haue, and therefore, though with perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution we preach the law to leade you to the Goſpel; we preach iudgement, that you may finde mercie; wee
<pb facs="tcp:178039:55"/> preach hel to bring you to heauen; whatſoeuer &amp; how ſoeuer, we preach, we doe all to fill your hearts with ioy in beleeuing, and hauing made you fruitfull in all good workes, preſent you without ſpot, nay glorious alſo, as a virgin moſt beautifull, to the Lord of all grace &amp; glorie, Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we haue heard of <hi>Ionah</hi> called, and charged to cry: but what ſhould he cry? Indeede it is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this place. But what then? Why then the Papiſts may ſay, that he was charged to crie againſt them for neglecting their traditions. Aſſuredly they may with as great trueth and as much probabilitie, as they doe gather <note place="margin">Iohn 16. 12. Ioh. 21. 25. Acts 1. 3. 1. Tim. 6. 20. 2.

But <hi>Ionah</hi> hath not left it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full what he was to cry, for in the third chapter, verſe 2. the charge is repeated, and thus expreſſed: Goe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime againſt it the proclamation which I ſpeake vnto thee. He was then to cry what God had commanded him. O that none would crie but what God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded!</p>
                  <p>But what did God command him to crie? euen that which he afterward cried: Yet fortie daies, and Niniuie ſhall be ouerturned. Ouerturned? yea ancient Niniuie, faire Niniuie, proud Niniuie muſt be deſtroyed. No man ſits ſo high, but deſtruction ſits aboue him, and will fall on all that perſiſt in their defection. Iuſtice would haue come againſt them, before it cried againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but God the moſt gratious would haue them cried againſt, that they might cry out, woe and alas for their ſinnes, ſo preuenting deſerued and threatned vengeance: for they hearing the crie of God, cried out themſelues, and that in great humbling to God, ſo God heard their cries, and tooke pitty on them.</p>
                  <p>Iſaiah was commanded to cry, and he cried: All ſleſh is graſſe, yea all the glorie thereof like the flower of the <note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 6. 7.</note> field. The graſſe withereth, the flower fadeth when the
<pb facs="tcp:178039:55"/> ſpirit of Iehouah bloweth on it. Surelie the people is graſſe. Iohn was commanded in the ſpirit of Eliah to cry, and he cried, Prepare the way of Iehouah, make euen in the deſert a path for our God. And <hi>Ionah</hi> was <note place="margin">Eſay 40. Matth. 3. 3. Ion. 1. 2. &amp; 3. 2.

                  <q>For their wickedneſſe is come vp before me.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For, &amp;c.</hi> We haue heard the charge it ſelfe giuen, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy newes, that a moſt beautifull Citie, a moſt rich Citie, a moſt populous Citie, and a moſt ancient Citie, muſt be ouerturned, and that within fortie daies; what is the cauſe? Their wickednes is come vp before me: as if hee had ſaid, Niniuie hath followed her luſts, and forgotten the Law, to ſatisfie her deſires; ſhe hath notoriouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed her ſoueraigne, defied all wel-meaning, all good dealing: and this is known to the iuſt Iudge, and at his barre ſhe is arraigned, and her accuſers ſtand crying at the barre for iuſtice. Therefore ſhe may no longer bee forborne, execution of iuſtice muſt needs be done: let her therefore prepare for death; and that ſhe may <hi>Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her yet fortie daies and Niniuie ſhall be ouerturned: for their wickedneſſe is come vp before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When God ſends criers vnto a people, it is a moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſigne that their wickednes is come vp before him, which doth cauſe him thus to exclaime, thus to cry out againſt them. And then if they will not repent whileſt
<pb facs="tcp:178039:56"/> Gods criers continue crying amongſt them, the Lord of Hoſtes will riſe vp in armes againſt them.</p>
                  <q>Their wickedneſſe.</q>
                  <p>Will you ſee the Niniuities ſins in a ſcroll, that withall you the daughters of Niniuie may ſee, that wealth and wickednes goe together, proſperity and ſecuritie kiſſe each other? Niniuie (ſaith Nahum) was like a poole of waters, moſt populous, and full of all ſtore, which to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, <note place="margin">Nah. 2. 8. 9.</note> it was wholly full of lying, deceit &amp; fraud, full of <note place="margin">3. 1. and 2, 11. 12.

Moreouer, it was the Miſtris of witchcrafts, a moſt ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous citie, yea ſold people through her whoredomes, <note place="margin">Nah. 3. 4.</note> and Nations through her witchcrafts, and made other idolatrous like her ſelfe, as 2. Kin. 16. 10.</p>
                  <q>Their wickedneſſe is come vp before me.</q>
                  <p>Sinne mounts vp on hie, like the tempter which led Chriſt vnto the top of the pinacle, to behold al the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world at once, and then becauſe wee haue falne down before the god of this world, and tempted the God of heauen, whether he be iuſt, or no; therefore wrath ſpeakes out of the fire, Now thou haſt taken thy pleaſure, thou muſt take alſo thy puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>A moſt heauy and greeuous thing it is, if you knew what you are doing here, and what your ſinnes are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the barre of Gods iuſt iudgement. For euen now before you came hither, you were ſeruing the diuell in ſinne, but now it is too late to ſpeake of it, and where are they now? fleſh and blood could not ſtay them, nature could not ſtay them, pleaſures could not ſtay them, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches could not ſtay them, nor they could not ſtay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but they are aſcended vp before the face of the eternall God, to ſtand at his barre and cry for vengeance
<pb facs="tcp:178039:56"/> to fall vpon vs, for committing ſuch hainous ſinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the maieſty of God.</p>
                  <p>An arrow is ſwift, the Sunne is ſwifter, but ſinne is ſwifteſt of all: for in a moment it is committed on earth, it comes before God in heauen, &amp; is condemned to hell, for though Nimrod could not climbe vp to heauen, his ſinnes flew vp to heauen: and though wee ſtay below, our ſinnes aſcend high, like the tower of Nimrod, but they fling vs down to confuſion, &amp; we become Babel. For when we ſinne we are as the ſhel-fiſh which the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle taketh, and flieth into the aire with, and then letteth it fall vpon the rockes, and ſo daſheth it in peeces, and then deuoures it. For the wrath of God taketh vs vp on hie, and throweth vs downe low vpon the rockes of ſhame and contempt, and terrour of conſcience: and ſo hauing cruſhed vs, &amp; bruiſed our very bones, conſumes vs with double death, the graue deuouring vs, hel ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vs.</p>
                  <q>Is come vp before me.</q>
                  <p>To them which aske, how our ſinnes aſcend and flie vp before God; J anſwer, God here ſpeakes vnto vs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner of men, who cannot ſee a thing afore it be brought vnto them, euen where they are, and before them. So that hereby is ſignified God had ſeene their wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>We faſt as before him, we pray as before him, we giue almes as before him, and wee doe euery good thing as before him, becauſe we doe it freely, and as it were, not caring who looks vpon vs. But we ſinne as behind him, becauſe we hide and cloke our ſinnes, and commit them in ſecret, loath that men ſhould ſpie them: our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuch actions accuſing vs, &amp; inſtantly telling vs, we are about that which we cannot iuſtifie. And wee ſuppoſe that we ſinne behinde him, becauſe wee ſinne here below, ſaying with our ſelues in the conſideration of our blinded hearts, as Eliphaz accuſed Iob to haue
<pb facs="tcp:178039:57"/> ſaid: Is not God in the height of heauen? and ſee the <note place="margin">Iob 27. 12. 13 14</note> highneſſe of the ſtarres, how high are they? Therefore how ſhould God know it? Should he be able to ſee through the darke? The thicke cloudes are a couering to him, that he may not ſee, and hee walketh vp and downe the round circle of the heauens. But then chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we imagine that God beholds vs not, when men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee vs: as if God could not know, what man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpie. But let vs not deceiue our ſelues, for God ſeeth not as man ſeeth. Man can ſee but only outward things committed in action, but God ſeeth, and knoweth, and ſearcheth the ſecrets of the heart, yea the ſecreteſt thoughts and imaginations of it. Againe, man can ſee but one thing at once, he cannot turne his right eye one way, &amp; left eie another: he cannot ſee before him &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him with one looke: but God ſeeth all things at all times. Though we ſinne as cloſely as we can for feare of hatred, or ſhame of the world, or for any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, yet God ſaith, your ſinne is come vp before mee. For though we couer it, and hide it, and colour it, yea and as it were bury it as well as lieth in vs, yet all is open vnto him: therefore he ſaith, your ſinne is come vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</p>
                  <p>For when we ſpeake euill, he is all eares to heare vs, and when we doe euill, he is all eyes to beholde it: Therefore, O fooliſh man, doe not thinke that God ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not which man ſeeth not: for when he lookes vp, he ſees all below alſo, and when he lookes downe, he ſees all aboue alſo. If he ſhould not, much wickedneſſe ſhould lie in darknes vnrewarded, and men ſhould not be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from ſinne, but rather by the example of other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured to ſinne freely ſecretly. For Ananias might haue gained by his craft, if God had not ſeene his heart, which <note place="margin">Acts 5</note> men ſaw not: but God ſaw his diſtruſtfull, and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and corrupt heart, therefore he loſt his goods, and his life too.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:178039:57"/>
                  <p>If God had not ſeene that which men ſee not, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hezi might haue gained a bribe for his labour, when he <note place="margin">2. King. 5.</note> ranne after Naaman the Aſſyrian, &amp; tolde him a lie for his profit. But God ſeeing his fetches, which men ſaw not, turned his bribe to a leproſie, and ſo made him a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for his labour. A fearfull example for ſuch as take bribes, yet many care not what bribes they take, ſo men ſee it not.</p>
                  <p>The man that ſaid, Be merry my ſoule, and take thy <note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> pleaſure for many yeares, might haue done it, ahd not God ſeene him: but hee eſpied him falling to godleſſe ſecuritie, and threatned him, that night to bereau him of his ſoule. Forget it not yee that abound in wealth, whoſe cup runneth ouer. If God had not ſeene Achan take vp the peece of gold, he had kept it to himſelfe for his labour, and no man ſhould haue knowne where he <note place="margin">Ioſu. 7.</note> had it. But God ſeeing it (though cloſely done) rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him with ſhame in the ſight of all Iſrael. O Lord, what is man that thou ſo watcheſt him? Achan would neuer haue ſtole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he had known that God did ſee him. Gehezi durſt neuer haue taken a bribe, if he had thought that God beheld his doings. Wilt thou ſteale, the owner looking on thee? Wilt thou ſpeak treaſon in the kings hearing? neither would we lie, nor ſweare, nor ſteale, nor hurt, nor be prophane at any time, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that the Lord ſeeth vs, &amp; remembred that he watcheth vs: if we would do this, ſinne might go a beginning for want of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Therefore if you wil marke but this part of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that God ſeeth all, you would refraine from thoſe things ſecretly, that are to the offence of God, which you for feare or ſhame wil not doe before men: and you would ſay euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is at it, I wil not do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord ſeeth me. But as when we ſin though in ſecret, he is all eies to ſee vs, &amp; when he ſees it requiſite to make ſome example, to teach all, that when man cannot nor wil not diſcouer vs, he will ſhew that he ſaw vs; then
<pb facs="tcp:178039:58"/> he is all hand to puniſh and plague vs, and in the end, to roote vs out from all our pleaſures: ſo when we repent, he is all mercie and loue; and when we amend our liues, and leaue all our wicked waies, to walke before him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after in holines, then he is all truth and righteouſnes, to forgiue vs all our former wicked life, and to waſh vs from all our vncleannes. Now therefore repent thee of all the euill that thou haſt done, lament truly, runne and hie thee as faſt as euer thou canſt to the throne of grace, prone whether thy repentance will not as boldly ſtand before God, and as powerfully cry for pardon, as thy ſinnes ſpeedily came vp before God, and vehemently cried fhr puniſhment. No doubt the Angel that cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Fallen is, fallen is Babylon the great, Reu. 18. 2. though he cried vehemently with a loud voyce, cried not ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly as thou ſhalt heare the ſpirit of truth crying &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring thee thy ſins are forgiuen thee; the God of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie loueth thee, ſinne ſhall no longer raigne in thee, no euill ſhall hurt thee, no good thing ſhall be wanting to thee, all things ſhall work together to the beſt for thee. <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.

                  <q>But Ionah roſe vp to flie to Tarſhiſh from the preſence of the Lord.</q>
                  <p>We cannot ſtand to ſpeake of Tarſhiſh, nor what it is to flie from God, but this ſhall be our meditation: <hi>Ionah</hi> the Prophet was commaunded to goe to Niniuie, and there to cry out againſt ſin, to preach againſt pride, and all kind of vngodlineſſe, thereby to reclaime them, and ſtirre them vp, in laying open their ſinne, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that banged ouer them, that they might ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily repent, and ſo turne away from them the wrath of God thereby deſerued. How beautifull ſhould haue beene the feete of him that ſhould haue brought ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull a meſſage, as ſhould haue wrought ſuch an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effect? How bleſſed ſhould Niniuie haue beene
<pb facs="tcp:178039:59"/> when the Lord had vouchſafed them ſo great mercie? but ſtill one flie or other marres the whole box of oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: As ſoone as he was commanded to goe thither, Satan ſtood in the gap, and enticed him to goe to Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh, for he thought, that if he could let <hi>Ionah</hi> from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Eccl. 10. 1.</note> to Niniuie, then firſt of all he ſhould put a ſingular Prophet out of Gods fauour, and bring vpon him ſome iudgement, not onely inward, as torment of conſcience, decay of gifts, or the like: but viſible alſo, whereby the people to whom he had preached, might thinke he was ſome falſe Prophet, as they are euer ready to condemne for hated of God, whom they ſee grieouſly afflicted. And ſo ſecondly the people ſhould be hardened in their ſins, and obſtinately condemne euer after, him, his like, and their preaching too. And thirdly, the godlieſt, the moſt populous, &amp; the wealthieſt City in Aſſyria ſhould be deſtroyed, the good with the wicked, the yong with the old, one with another, all ſhould vnrepentant die in their ſinnes, and ſo the very Angels in heauen ſhould mourne. So that he thought he ſhould by ſtopping <hi>Ionah,</hi> euery way gaine well by his labour.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he comes to <hi>Ionah,</hi> he flatters him, he tempts him, thus he begins with him: It is good that men looke before they leape, haſte makes waſte, words are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to betaken as they properly ſignifie: one thing is often ſpoken, and another meant: but thinkeſt thou God meaneth thou ſhouldeſt goe to Niniuy? Why? doth he regard idolaters, and his profeſſed enemies, ſo that to haue them admoniſhed of their ruine, he will bring ſhame vpon his own people? for the very going of a Prophet from Iſrael to preach to Niniuy, muſt needs proclaime that there is more hope of moſt ſinfull Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, then of naturall Iſraelites. And how couldeſt thou ſeeme ſo to thinke of thine owne Nation, thine owne brethren, thine owne blood, the choſen of God? Or if thou doe, ſhalt thou not thereby procure their vtter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb facs="tcp:178039:60"/> for euer, and make them to deteſt both thy perſon, and whatſoeuer thy preaching, whatſoeuer thou haſt heeretofore, or heareafter ſhalt teach them?</p>
                  <p>What? for thy faithfull prophecying heere among Gods people, will God, thinkeſt thou, recompence thee, thee whom he hath made reuerend, and to be honoured of Kings and Princes of Iſrael: recompence, I ſay, thee with ſhame and contempt among heathens, yea, with a cruell death, or with a more miſerable life? For what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſucceſſe may bee hoped for at the Niniuites hands of ſuch a meſſage by thee? For thou knoweſt they haue all Iewes in contempt: therefore when thou ſhalt come among them, and tell them not theſe few words onely, and in this forme which God hath ſpoken them in; for if thou ſo doe, who will not count thee rather a mad-man then Gods Prophet? But at large, that there is one all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, moſt iuſt, almighty, and euerliuing God, and no moe? and ſo all their gods are no gods but idols: and that they aboue all other haue giuen his glory to ſtockes and ſtones, worſhipping them for gods, alluring and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing others likewiſe to diſhonor him: that they haue abuſed his bleſſings moſt vnthankfully, moſt vngodly to all exceſſe, and are moſt proud contemners of their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; moſt notorious drunkards, gluttons, fornicators, adulterers, theeues, oppreſſors, witches, murtherers, and the like; &amp; therefore haue ſo prouoked him that is moſt merciful &amp; patient, that he will without all pity deſtroy man, woman, yong and old, high and low amongſt them; yea, their very Citie alſo, and all that is therein, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they haue beene ſo wicked, and that within fortie daies.</p>
                  <p>When, J ſay, thou being a Iew, ſhalt tell them this, thus in deſpight reuile (for ſo they will take it) thus vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemne them and their gods: will not the beſt of them mocke and deſpiſe thee? will not the reſt gnaſh their teeth at thee, bee readie to teare thee in peeces, put
<pb facs="tcp:178039:60"/> thee to exquiſite torments, condemne thee to ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible death, or continue thee in intollerable paines, in a moſt bitter life? No queſtion. Thinke not therefore that thy good God, thy moſt kind and tender father, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence thy faithfulnes, with ſending thee ſo far to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine ſuch miſery: It were impiety to think he willed it, it is blaſphemy, terrible blaſphemy to think he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds it: for it is to condemne him of vnkindnes, for thou haſt ſhewed feruent loue; of vntruth, for hee hath promiſed it ſhould go wel with the iuſt; of iniuſtice, for godlineſſe ſhould haue the reward due onely to wickedneſſe. Yea he ſhould ſeeme contrary to himſelfe, to charge thee cruelly to murther thy ſelfe, which hath commanded all to kill none, if he ſhould will thee to prouoke that bloody citie ſo. But the very thing it ſelfe alſo argueth, God meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe then to commit thee to ſuch danger, or that thou ſhouldſt do to the proud Niniuites ſuch a meſſage. For to what end ſhouldſt thou ſo cry againſt that Citie? to make them flie, and ſo to free them from deſtruction? How ſholdſt thou then not bee found a falſe Prophet, and God a lier? What then? To bring them to repentance &amp; then to ſpare them? how ſhould not God ſo againe be found vntrue, &amp; thou his lying meſſenger? what then? To conuert them, and ſo to deſtroy them? what iuſtice were that? and how contrary to his promiſe to Salomon? 2. Sam. 7. 14. Therefore it is manifeſt, God meant not thou ſhouldſt go and cry ſo againſt Niniuie, but ſignified that thou wert as good, for any good may be done here, to exclaime ſo like a frantike man againſt Niniuie, as to preach in <hi>Samaria</hi> any longer now. Men here are ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned that they contemne all, part are ſo cloyed that they loath all, the beſt part little eſteeme all that is preached: of none is the word accounted pretious, of none reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently heard: and therefore thou ſhouldeſt for a time, to make the word pretious, and to ſharpen mens affections towards it, giue ouer preaching heere, and where thou
<pb facs="tcp:178039:61"/> wilt refreſh thy ſelfe a while. Now heere thou maieſt not be idle: at Tarſhiſh thou maieſt be quiet: thou maieſt at Taiſhiſh that famous Citie, among the ſtrangers of many Countries, heare many ſtrange things, much delight thy ſelf in the variety of their maners, in the abundance of all things, with great pleaſure liue. No time ſo fit as this to ſee the worlde. At Iapho thou canſt not want ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thither. Seeme not to make ſmall account of this kindneſſe of God, defraud not thy ſelfe of the graunted good.</p>
                  <p>Thus Sathan is euer croſſing, tempting, enticing vs when wee are or ſhould be addreſſing our ſelues to doe the will of our God. So was Moiſes, Ieremy, Ezechiel, <note place="margin">Exo. 3. 11. &amp;. 4. 10. 13. Ier. 1 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Sathan hath deſired to ſift and winnow you as wheate. Who are theſe whoſe perill ſathan ſo earneſtly deſireth? Euen Peters, and Iames, and Iohns. No maruaile, for Chriſt himſelfe, though acknowledged the Sonne of God, was moſt fiercely aſſaulted of the tempter fortie daies, and then indeed was left, but it was onely for a ſeaſon, Luke. 4. 13. Therefore neuer dreame of a truce with Sathan, whoſoeuer thou be, whatſoeuer thou art about to doe. For the enemy, the enuious foe, the tempter, the falſe accuſer goeth about continually ſeeking whom he may deuoure. Now his manner of tempting is, firſt and moſt vſually with flattering, but yet very often with moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible threatning. For whatſoeuer we doe or feele, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from one of theſe three ſpirits, the ſpirit of ſathan, the Spirit of God, or our ſpirit. Now our owne ſpirit of it ſelfe is alwaies occupied about worldly things, ſeeking delights in pleaſures, not diſquiet by threats. The ſpirit of God is gentle, louing, and meeke, not forcing, nor threatning. Therefore Chriſt ſaith, If any will follow me let him deny himſelfe and take vp his croſſe daily, &amp;c. <note place="margin">Luke 19. 23.</note> And mark his ſpirit, he ſaith not, you ſhall follow me, but
<pb facs="tcp:178039:61"/> you ſhall denie your ſelues, and take vp your croſſe, but if any will follow me, let him deny himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe: <hi>Let him.</hi> The ſame is to be ſeene in the Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <note place="margin">Cantic. 5. 2.</note> where he ſaith: Open vnto me my ſiſter, my loue, my doue, my vndefiled. For mine head is full of deaw, and my lockes with the droppes of the night. For <note place="margin">3.</note> when ſhe opened not vnto him, making moſt vnmeete excuſes, though he had moſt louingly praied, and liuely vrged her to open, and ſhe moſt vnkindly, moſt vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily had denied, yet the went his way mildly without <note place="margin">2. 4. 6.</note> any threats. But the ſpirit of Sathan takes an other courſe: For when by lying and deceit he cannot allure to ſinne, he threatens moſt fearfully with ſinne, griefe, or loſſe of goods, ſolitarines and want of pleaſure, and ſomtime by his miniſters, impes of his owne likeneſſe, hee threatens death, and deadly torments, whatſoeuer they may inflict vpon any.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſaith; If you will follow me. If you will: but he ſaith, I will make ye follow me, and doe as I bid you, you ſhall haue fire and fagot, ſcalding lead and burning pitch; if you will not follow mee, you ſhall, whether you will or no: we will make you doe as we command, ſaith his eldeſt ſonne Antichriſt, vſurping authority ouer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inflicting torments on the Saints. His order of tempting is, firſt to make vs doubt of the word of God: whether ſuch and ſuch doctrine be true, ſuch and ſuch an action bee commanded, ſuch and ſuch a promiſe, ſuch and ſuch a threatning be certain. Then ſecondly he falles to flat denying of it, this doctrine, theſe promiſes, theſe threatnings are falſe, this thing is not commanded, this action is not condemned. And then comes he in with his contradiction, contrary aſſertions, &amp; countermands. For there is no commandement of God, but the diuell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the contrary, &amp; he is euer gaine ſaying that which <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> God ſaith For our God ſaith vnto Adam, if you eate of the forbidden fruit, you ſhall ſurely die: the diuell came
<pb facs="tcp:178039:62"/> and he told them, firſt <hi>ti is not certaine you ſhall die:</hi> then, you ſhall not die; then thirdly, you ſhal be as gods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 4. 5. 1. Pet. 5. 5.</note> good from euill. God ſaith, ſubmit your ſelues one to another in brotherly loue: the diuell ſaith, firſt, you neede not to abaſe your ſelues ſo much; ſecondly, you ſhould not yeelde to others: then thirdly, aduance your ſelues, and contemne others. God ſaith, Loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 39.</note> as thy ſelfe: the diuel ſaith, firſt loue little and our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, then, loue none but thy ſelfe: then thirdly, hate thine enemies, enuie thy betters, diſdaine thine equalls, deſpiſe thine inferiours. God ſaith, Labor for that foode that periſheth not: the diuell ſaith, firſt, care not much <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 27.</note> for it: then ſecondly, contemne it: then thirdly, ſtirre not an inch for it. God ſaith, Forſake the world: the Diuell ſaith, firſt, neglect not the world; then, loue <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2. 1. Iohn 3. 18.</note> the world, then thirdly, giue ouer your ſelues vnto the world aboue all, follow the world with all the luſts thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now, the meanes whereby the diuell tempts, are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments fetcht, ſome from the wit and reaſon of man, or from the cuſtomes of the world: ſome from the holy Scriptures, either corrupted, or wrong applied: now in conſideration of the perſons, then in regard of the thing it ſelfe, &amp;c. In reſpect of the perſons to whom hee ſhould preach, and himſelfe, <hi>Ionah</hi> is here tempted, and ſo thus reaſoneth with himſelfe: I haue long preached vnto the Iewes, which are the choſen people of God, &amp; ſeeing they will not heare me, it is in vaine to preach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Gentiles, which neuer heard of God or godlines, and therefore will eſteeme my words the leſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Ionah</hi> is loath to loſe his labour, and puts in a doubt where he needes not, becauſe he conſidered not the great power of God in mens harts. The Niniuites are heathen people, and therefore (ſaith <hi>Ionah</hi>) why ſhould I venture my ſelfe amongſt them? For ſeeing my owne countrymen kicke againſt my wordes, and
<pb facs="tcp:178039:62"/> cannot abide to heare the word which commeth from the Lord to reprooue ſinne, then how much more ſhall I be deſpiſed theſe, and perſecuted to death? Thus fleſh and blood ſtandeth ſtaggering when it ſhould doe any good, miſdoubting troubles, iealous of his owne eaſe: but when it goeth about to doe any miſchiefe, it neuer conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the danger, it weighteth not the following wo: yet doing good, it is vncertaine whether all will not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or euen aboue our hope ſucceede; it is more likelie we ſhould be kept ſafe: but doing euill, miſchiefe moſt certainely is procured, not danger onely, but loſſe of the beſt things commonly, peace of conſcience or ſpirituall graces, of ſome bleſſings alway, or at leaſt not receit of thoſe things which much would reioyce vs. For ſure this was a ſore temptation, to bid a man (being in reaſonable good eſtate touching his body and life) that hee ſhould goe and preach vnto a ſauage heathen people that neuer <note place="margin">Deut. 6 4.</note> heard of preaching, and that this doctrine; that there is but one onely true God, to them who will ſerue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and cannot abide the contrary to be ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>If a Preacher were commanded to goe and preach at Rome gates, againſt Antichriſts iuriſdiction &amp; the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry that is ſo inordinately vſed in that Sinagogue of vncleannes, ſeeing that is a matter for which they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and kill all that preach it ſincerely: I feare it would hardly come to paſſe at all, that this preacher would go from a reaſonable quiet eſtate touching his body, to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his life among ſuch cruell tyrants: I feare hee would rather content himſelfe with his preſent eaſe, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to ſo likely miſerie.</p>
                  <p>If I goe to preach vnto theſe infidels, ſaying, yet forty daies and Niniuie ſhall be deſtroyed, then (ſaith <hi>Ionah</hi>) it may be, they will repent, &amp; God wil haue mercy vpon them, ſo I ſhall be counted a falſe Prophet for my labour. And thus we regard our credite more then the glory of God, in the obedience of his will: and rather then wee
<pb facs="tcp:178039:63"/> would receiue any reproch by your doings (in the ſight of the world,) we rather chooſe to enter into no great action touching the glory of God, and the good of the Church. In reſpect of the Iſraelites and himſelfe: If I leaue mine owne people, and preach vnto the Gentiles (ſaith <hi>Ionah</hi>) I ſhall bring ſhame vpon Iſrael before all people, becauſe a Prophet is gone from them for their obſtinacie, chooſing rather to preach vnto vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Gentiles then vnto them, as if there were more hope of the Gentiles then of them. So <hi>Ionah</hi> more feareth the childrens diſgrace then the Fathers diſhonour, and their deſpight, then his diſpleaſure. Sathan is too well acquainted with mans nature, and ſo more cartainelie knowes, then we wiſely conſider, that all Adams ſonnes are from labour eaſily brought to loiter: more willingly from feare and paine, to ſecuritie and pleaſure: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeldome or neuer doth he in tempting omit this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement; It will be for thy eaſe, for thy delight, for thy ſecuritie. Therefore he ſaith to <hi>Ionah,</hi> not onely the way to Niniuie is long and dangerous, thy perſon and meſſage odious, therfore thy trauell muſt needs bee tedious, thy troubles greeuous, &amp;c. but alſo thy paſſage to Tarſhiſh is eaſie, thy ſecurity there ſure, thy pleaſures many, thy delight great. Yea, with this he aſſaulted Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſaying, when hee had ſhewed him all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world, and the glory of them: All theſe will I giue thee, &amp;c. And doth thee not ſo alſo euermore perſwade vs, this good; this gaine, this glory, this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or this preferment ſhalt thou get, if thou thus and thus deale? if if you will leaue the ſociety, the exerciſes, the profeſſion, and the company of the children of God, and ſerue me, and worſhip mee: preferring your couetouſneſſe, your pride, your luſt, before the ſeruice of God: not being ſcrupulous to ſweare for your gaine ſometime, nor to lie for your pleaſure, nor to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for riches: then you ſhall not onely be free from
<pb facs="tcp:178039:63"/> the reproches wherewith profeſſors are ouerwhelmed and the contempt wherein they are had, and the manie heauy ſighes that they are forced to fetch, but you ſhall alſo grow rich ſoone, and ſo be well thought of, and had in eſtimation, and by your wealth liue in eaſe with al plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, procuring euery thing your at hearts deſire.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Ionah,</hi> which way ſoeuer he looke, is tempted on euery ſide: tempted to ſinne, but not conſtrained: vrged, but not compelled: for the diuell hath power to entice to ſinne mightily, but not to enforce violently. Loe then comforts againſt this croſſe.

                  <p>But what doth <hi>Ionah,</hi> thus as we haue heard by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than aſſaulted? reſiſts he as manfully as the Diuell hath ſet on him cunningly?

                  <p>We haue ſeene ſome cauſes why ſathan aſſaulting vs, hee ſtraight ouercomes vs: would any ſee more? we haue bin taught his power, malice, watchfulnes, and wilines: we haue moſt fit and ſufficient armor miniſtred vnto vs: we haue a promiſe, that reſiſting him, we ſhall make him <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 11. 14. 10. 16.

But moreouer, we to our owne certaine perill and paine (ſo corrupt are we) ioyne with our enemy, more readie to doe his will then Gods word. Hereof no doubt foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Balaam asked againe and againe, till God ſeeing him bent contrary to that he had bin commanded, left him <note place="margin">Num. 22. 8. 19. 21.</note> vnto himſelfe: and ſo Balaam went on in ſinne ſo long, till the very Aſſe whereon he rode, was conſtrained to reproue him. But would you howſoeuer Sathan temmpts, not be turned by him out of the right way? howſoeuer he fights, not to be foiled by him? would you haue him ſoone to forſake you, ſpeedily to flie from you, that is, would you reſiſt him? for when wee begin valiantly to fight, then forthwith he flies. Conſider how ſhamefull a
<pb facs="tcp:178039:64"/> thing it is, being euery way encouraged to fight, to ſhew our ſelues moſt daſtardly cowards: how diſhonourable to our captaine Chriſt, to yeeld the victory to his deadly enemy: how dangerous for our ſelues, knowing he is a moſt cruell tyrant, and moſt inexorable, that moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſpecially takes pleaſure in putting vs to the moſt bitter paine that poſſibly he can, and therefore hauing ouercome vs, will for euer continue vs in moſt intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torments. Yea, ſaieſt thou, theſe things conſidered would make vs couragiouſly to encounter with Sathan, and ſo ſoone to conquer him; but he comes often as a friend, as an Angell of light: how ſhall I then deſcry him, that I may deſie him and make him to flie?</p>
                  <p>How? here indeed is the hardnes: for he is a notable hypocrite, the father of hypocriſie. But thou muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the counſell of Chriſt, Reu. 3. 18. Thou muſt anoint thine eies with the eye ſalue, that thou maieſt ſee. Thou muſt be fulfilled with the knowledge of Gods will in all wiſedom &amp; ſpirituall vnderſtanding, &amp; moreouer watch <note place="margin">Col. 1. 9. 1. Pet. 5. 8.</note> and be ſober. And laſtly, conſider, firſt how thy ſpirit is affected: for our owne ſpirit (by nature euermore hard) if it be moued by the ſpirit of God, is ſad, ſoft, and flow: but if it be moued by the ſpirit of Sathan is proud, boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, and ſtout: then, whether that which thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mooued to be good or euill: if good, that is, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods word, then acknowledge it comes from God, for all good motions are the worke of the ſpirit of God, howſoeuer they ſeeme to proceed of our ſelues. But if it be euill, that is, not agreeable with the word of God, then it is alwaies either a luſt of our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or a ſuggeſtion of Sathan. Wherefore it is a ſure way to ſay when we are tempted to euil, this motion is of the diuell, for euen our corruption came of his ſuggeſtion. For the ſpirit of man is alwaies toſſed betweene theſe two contrary ſpirits, the ſpirit of God procuring our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, &amp; the ſpirit of ſathan ſeeking our condemnation.
<pb facs="tcp:178039:65"/> So that if any will get the victory of Sathan, he may not be without the ſpiritual ſword, which is the word of God Epheſi. 6. 17. Yea, he muſt haue the word of God dwell in him plenteouſly, Col. 3. 17. and cry ſtill, Open mine eyes, O Lord, Pſalm. 119. 18 Giue me vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, 34. and encline mine hart vnto thy teſtimonies. 36 and beware that he ſubmit himſelfe duely, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watch.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Ionah</hi> tempted, hath conſented to neglect his charge, and doth he forth-with repent? No, he prepares himſelfe to his purpoſed iourney. <hi>But Ionah aroſe to fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Ionah</hi> made himſelfe a run-away and ſhewed himſelfe a diſobedient ſeraunt to his God. And in the meane while, Niniuie ſet on the ſcore, and had no hoe with them in working wickedneſſe: but ſtill filling the cuuppe of all abominations, ranne downe to hell with as much force and ſpeede as they could. So Niniuie is ſtill Niniuie, but <hi>Ionah</hi> is not like <hi>Ionah,</hi> for the Prophet is flying, and ſin is crying, and ſo al falles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
                  <q>But Ionah aroſe vp to flie vnto Tarſhiſh, &amp;c.</q>

                     <hi>Ionah</hi> flyeth vnto Tarſhiſh before he would goe to Niniuie; and euery one is like the ſonne which ſaid hee would not, before he went: and ſo ſinne is borne firſt, as Eſau, was borne before Iacob. Therefore if euill may compare with goodnes in particular actions, in al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 25. 26</note> corrupt, euill may ſay he is the ancienter. But as ſoone as thou perceiueſt any euill cogitation or motion in thy ſelfe, be thou wroth with it, nip it in the head, put it to death, and then the vncleane ſpirit that hath long bene ſtrong, and with delight dwelt in thee, will ſoone <note place="margin">Math. 8 31.</note> be weary of thy houſe, and ſay as the euill ſpirit ſaid; Here is no dwelling for vs, let vs goe to yonder heard of ſwine.</p>

                     <hi>Ionah</hi> was ſent to Niniuie, but he went toward Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh. And ſo it is alwaies with vs, wee are euer doing that we ſhould not doe. For either we doe nothing, or that which we are not commaunded, or elſe otherwiſe then we are commanded. Sometime moſt rebelliouſly we do that which we know the Lord ſtraitly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. And as <hi>Ionah</hi> tooke Tarſhiſh for Niniuie, ſo we take the diuell for an Angell, light for darkneſſe, &amp;c. <hi>But Ionah roſe vp, &amp;c.</hi> They that ſhould preach at Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, are flying to Tarſhiſh, and though hee bee like a drone, yet doth hee, euen the Non-reſident, keepe his beneficie faſting, feaſting himſelfe: but wilt thou keepe it ſtill? go and preach at Niniuie as ye haue been doubly commanded, or for ſhame leaue your priuledge and benefice: but they ſtand ſtaggering, aſhamed to keepe it, and loth to leaue it. For the ſweete morſels of Baals prieſts are pleaſant vnto them, that they cannot find in their hearts to leaue them, as long as they are able to keep them. But no maruaile that <hi>Ionah</hi> fled to Tarſhiſh, when he ſhould go to Niniuie. For this is a ſtumbling vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation amongſt men, yea reiected by the children of this world which alway kick againſt it: ſo that if you would aske for a painefull vocation, this is it; if for a thankleſſe vocation, this is it; if for a contemptible vocation, this it it: for reproouing, we are reproued: bleſſing, we are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: preaching peace we make war: proclaming liberty, we are impriſoned; doe what we can, we are perſecuted: &amp; for our worke worthy of loue, we receiue of the moſt, hatred: of few yea very few, not any more then a cold affection.

For the Lord was not ſo earneſt to ſtop the way of Balaam, leſt he ſhould commit wickednes, as the diuell is earneſt to ſtop the way of euery <hi>Ionah,</hi> leſt he fulfill righteouſnes, that is, cry againſt Niniuie, longing, and duely that is, wiſely, and earneſtly labouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert Niniuie.</p>
                  <q>But Ionah roſe vp to flie vnto Tarſhiſh from the preſence of the Lord, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>The righteous fall, and now no leſſe then a Prophet, yea ſuch a Prophet as was the figure of Chriſt. But who would haue thought that ſuch a Prophet ſhould flie from the Lord, yea and that when he ſhould doe him moſt ſeruice? who counteth that no wickedneſſe now, that he euer thought and taught was rebellion, while he was among the wicked? A fearefull example: therefore let him that thinks he ſtandeth, take hee left hee fall, for the way is ſlippery wherein we are to walke. When thou remembreſt the fall of the Prophets, then conſider that thou art much weaker then a Prophet, and therefore the eaſier to be encountred and ouerthrown, and the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to haue a moſt greeuous fall, except the Lord doe mightily vphold thee, ſeeing ſuch a one cannot ſtand in the ſight of his ſo mortal enemy, but by him receiueth ſo greeuous a fall. Secondly, if thou ſee <hi>Ionah</hi> flie, Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes murmure, Dauid fal to adultery, Salomon to Idolatry and Peter to forſweare his Maſter, then maiſt thou learn not to truſt to thine own ſtrength, for it is weaknes; not to thine owne wiſedome, for it is ſinfull; but ſeeke helpe <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 5.

Thirdly, iudge
<pb facs="tcp:178039:66"/> wiſely of the fal of <hi>Ionah,</hi> not raſhly condemning him for his fault: for although Dauid ioyned murther with adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, yet he repented, and is the deere child of God.</p>
                  <q>And he found a ſhip going to Tarſhiſh.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ionah</hi> was no ſooner come to <hi>Iapho,</hi> but he goes to the hauen, or meetes with Mariners, and preſently vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands of a ſhip, not going to Niniuie, but to Tarſhiſh. As ſoone as hee ſet forward to flie from God, Sathan ſtraightwaies prepared a ſhip, ſo that temptation and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſinne doe alwaies goe together. Shall <hi>Iudas</hi> lack money, or <hi>Ionah</hi> ſtay for a ſhip? No (ſaith Sathan) by the mouth of his miniſters; here <hi>Iudas,</hi> take thee money, and betray thy Maſter; and <hi>Ionah,</hi> here is a ſhip for thee: goe haſt thee away, and flie from the preſence of the Lord. For the diuell is alwaies a very ſeruiceable and pleaſant diuell to ſuch as flie from God: he can finde occaſion at all times, and meanes, and inſtruments fit for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If thou wilt flie from God, the diuel will lend thee both ſpurres and a horſe, yea a poſt-horſe, and that will carry you ſwiftly and luſtily away, vnto all vanitie and vngodly luſts. Therefore if any will aske what the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels occupation is, it is to tempt, to entice by all meanes, to prouoke to ſin, and then to prouide vs of the meanes to practiſe our purpoſe to commit (and as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) to bring forth ſinne.</p>
                  <q>And he payed the fare thereof.</q>
                  <p>This mony was caſt into the Sea, it did him as little good, as if hee had vtterly loſt it: it had beene good for him if he had loſt it, for it did him much harme. There are many that will ſpend and waſte, they care not how much vpon cards and dice, and vnlawfull games, this money alſo is caſt into the Sea, for it doth them much more harme then they know of it, doth them no good, it were good for them they had not a penny to loſe. And ſo men care not what they pay for vanities &amp; braueries, the moſt part of which is vnprofitable, &amp; rather hurtfull
<pb facs="tcp:178039:67"/> then neceſſary for them, but onely for the vaine vſe of the preſent time, and for ſome vaine reſpect: this alſo is caſt into the Sea, and better ſhould they be, if they had it not to lauiſh, and to their owne and many others hurt ſo to garniſh themſelues. Men care not what they pay for their vanities, ſo it doth pleaſe their mind for the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration of the end and vſe thereof; but they will giue little or nothing to do good withall: ſo that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus can get nothing, and Dauid can get no meat. Shal <note place="margin">Luke 16. 21. 1.

We can be content to giue any thing, or do any thing to win the world thereby but we will giue nothing nor doe nothing, thereby to win the kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>We haue heard <hi>Ionah</hi> confeſſing that hee receiued a charge to goe to Niniuie, but hee aroſe and fled toward Tarſhiſh, and went downe to Iapho, and found a ſhip, going to Tarſhiſh, and paid the fare thereof, and went downe into it: heereafter we ſhall heare, that being en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tred the ſhip, hee went to ſleepe, and ſlept ſoundly, and being wakened, hee confeſſed not his ſinne, but ſuffered the Mariners to deuiſe to find out for whoſe cauſe they were to troubled, and at length alſo the lots to bee caſt neuer confeſſing it vntill he was enforced to it. VVhat needed hee to rehearſe all this? had it not beene enough to haue ſaid, that he left his buſineſſe vndone, hee was a ſinner? No, for God would haue men to know the ſtubbornnes and diſobedience of <hi>Ionah,</hi> in that this, thing was not done vpon the ſudden, but vpon deliberation, and in no ſhort time, but in ſome continuance, while he went from Samaria to Iapho: and thence was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and had ſomewhile ſailed. In which ſpace hee had leaſure enough to haue repented, but did not. <hi>Ionah</hi> confeſſed his ſinne, that hee ſhould not once haue liſtned to ſathans aſſaults or reaſons of the fleſh, and when hee
<pb facs="tcp:178039:67"/> had liſtned, he ſhould not haue liked them, and when he had liked them he ſhould not haue conſented to obey them, and when he had conſented he ſhould not haue put them in practiſe; he ſhould not haue fled toward Iapho; and when he was come to Iapho, he ſhould not haue gone to the hauen; and when he came to the heauen, hee ſhould not haue paid the fare; and when hee had paid the fare, he ſhould not haue entred the ſhip, and when he was entred the ſhippe, he ſhould not haue hoyſed vp the ſailes, and ſailed, and gone to ſleepe. But this he did, teaching that ſinne runnes on wheeles, as it were downe a hill in a ll poſt-haſt, and neuer ſtaies till it ariue euen in hell. For <hi>Ionah</hi> thought becauſe he came ſafe to Iapho, therefore he might goe to the heauens &amp; becauſe he came well to the hauen, therefore he might pay the fare; and becauſe he paid the fare in peace, therfore he might take ſhipping; and becauſe he entred the ſhip in ſafety, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might hoyſe vp the ſailes to goe, and becauſe hee hoyſed vp the ſailes without danger, therefore he might go ſecurely to ſleepe, and ſafely to ſaile to Tarſhiſh.</p>
                  <p>So ſinnes follow one another like linkes of a chayne, till the tempeſt of deſtruction breake it in ſunder. So ſaith the forlorne ſinner, I haue ſworne, and God did not puniſh mee, therefore I will ſteale: I haue ſtoln and God did not puniſh mee, therefore I will kill. I haue killed and God did not puniſh me, then why may I not doe what I liſt? I may do this as wel as I haue done other things heeretofore. But if Ionah had conſidered with himſelfe that God is the Lord, who is all ſeeing &amp; almighty, from whom nothing can be concealed, hee would neuer haue taken his iourney to Iapho, or when he came to Iapho, hee would not haue paied the fare, or when he had paied the fare, hee would not haue entred the ship, or when he was gone into the ſhip, he would not haue hoiſt the ſailes, but rather would haue leapt out from that ſhip that ſhould carry him from his God,
<pb facs="tcp:178039:68"/> carrying him from his duty: but he forgets himſelfe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the creatures can hide him from the Creator, which <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 13.</note> is an abſurd thing to thinke, ſeeing nothing can bee hid from him: neither would any, I ſay, adde drunkenneſſe to thirſt, or heape ſinne vpon ſinne, or ſuffer an euill thought to take place in him, if they conſider that the iuſt Iehouah be held them in all their very thoughts. All thoſe that pity <hi>Ionah,</hi> let them pity themſelues; for if we conſider our owne eſtate, wee haue as many, and as ſoule ſinnes in vs, as there were in <hi>Ionah,</hi> yea in Niniuie <hi>Ionah</hi> confeſſed his ſinne, that we might confeſſe. Hee confeſſed it freely, he confeſſed it fully, that hee knew his maſters will, but not onely did it not, but alſo took ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe quite contrary to that which hee was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: and that not in purpoſe onely, but in deede al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; not for an houre, but a long time; not in ſtrugling with his weaknes, but in a profound vngodly careleſneſſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
